      "hello The flight AI301 scheduled at 7am of 14th May never left Melbourne because of an engine problem. They rescheduled us on a 2pm Thai flight on route Melbourne-Bangkok-Delhi. I got to Delhi at 3am instead of 6pm, when I booked the tickets through the Melbourne office they guaranteed me the transit hotel because my connection was more than 17 hours. When I got to Delhi a rude company attendant told me that they don't give this kind of service so I spent more than 10 hours on the airport. No way to speak with someone from the company during all this time. Air India never again - saved $300 compare with Emirates but a big mistake. Complain to the company and still waiting for an answer. Flight was half empty. Crew were cordial and food was served immediately. The light-changing windows were slightly annoying. Prefer Jet for short-haul and domestic routes. I read some bad reviews but it was mentioned the 787 was better. Not so in my case. I had an aisle seat. The seat reclining feature didn't work. I was forced to sit upright for the whole red eye flight of over 8 hours. The light switch on the remote didn't work so I couldn't even read. The lady in the window seat also had trouble with her seat. The food was not that great. The cabin staff were fine but not anything special like Emirates. About two hours after take off the cabin and lavatories were trashed. Safety was never an issue. All in all, I will avoid Air India, at least until I see some better reviews. On both sectors shabby aircraft interiors. The general appearance of the staff specially on the return flight was appalling. The grooming standards were low. The stewardess greeting customers in the aisle was leaning on a seat head rest with her hands on her chin and yawning - not the image that Air India wants to portray. The whole service and meal tray could be better. Their website is good and easy to use, the call centre staff are very polite and efficient - the airport in Delhi is a delight. DEL-LHR - Experience was overall satisfactory, within 20 minutes we reached cruising altitude and immediately snacks and drinks were served. I must say the flight steward looked dazed and did not look motivated. After serving food (very average), our plates were collected and cabin lights were immediately turned off. I did notice a few people wandering around the cabin, looking for a bite to eat and water/drinks. I was able to sleep well. Flight was on time, landed around 10 mins late into Heathrow. LHR-DEL - Experience was again a let down. To begin with we were 4.5 hours late, though we were informed well in advance. We finally boarded the aircraft and the first images of worn out carpets and shabby seat upholstery made the already disgruntled passengers more upset. Food was served very fast and lights were switched off! A couple of hours into our flight I got up to get a glass of water, I asked the air hostesses sitting at the back and they simply pointed their finger at a water dispenser, which I personally found very unprofessional. The experience at new Delhi T3 was a mood changer (for the good)! Flew Chicago to Delhi, business class, June 6 2015. Unlike most of my experience on other flights with Air India the crew disappeared after they served drinks and food. Just no service. On most other Airlines its common to see the crew walking with drinks every 15 mins or so. Well Air India did not think that's necessary. Food is average. Crew do not even bother to check if the amenities in the toilets are there. \r\n",
      " I flew from Ottawa via Montreal via Zurich to New Delhi then onwards to Calcutta. The flight from New Delhi to Calcutta was a total nightmare and I really don't recommend anyone flying with Air India at all. Flight was supposed to leave in the morning but didn't leave until 11.45 am. Staff unprofessional and didn't make this flight pleasant. Inflight entertainment in limited but you should bring your own IPad to watch movies music etc. Never again Air India. We had three domestic flights in April 2015 (DEL-UDR-BOM-GOI) all on A319 aircraft. The aircraft interior was quite filthy on all flights. The food and drink service was ok on all flights. However the cabin crew did not pay attention to any safety related issues on any of those flights. Seats were reclined during take off and landing by a lot of passengers little kids were running over their parents laps from across seat rows during take off and cabin crew did not offer belt extensions for securing infants. Air India needs to work on their staff attitude towards safety. Flew from Heathrow to Delhi in April this year. Cabin staff lack Professionalism. They hardly smile and seem frustrated as they have to serve passengers. There is no sense of customer service. Saw the crew sleeping during the flight instead of serving the passengers. The only question they ask \"veg or non veg\" without any \"Please\". Air India has to improve service to get competitive. The food was horrible. The toilets were disgraceful. The entertainment systems are broken and slow. Finally Air-India captains and crew need to polish up communication skills over the intercom as they have difficulty both in English and Hindi. Yes I still fly Air-India. I recently flew DEL-SYD on a 2.5 year old 787. It was in appalling condition. The aircraft was filthy. Many parts of the bathroom were held together with tape. Service was rude when rarely present. Overall a very poor experience. AI 933 flight from COK-SHJ on 29/03/2015. We were made to wait for 16 hrs in the airport with them changing the time every two hours and eventually told us the flight was cancelled. After a 16 hr delay they decided to shift the passengers to hotels. Food was not provided. The duty manager refused to attend the problems. Poor quality of communication. Planning not to fly Air India anymore. I flew Air from Sydney to Delhi and return because it was a non stop flight. On entering the aircraft it looked old and I found that my touch screen did not work. The toilets were disgusting smelt and were stained. Some panels were hanging loose. The floor was awash. On return the aircraft looked newer but the toilets were still disgraceful. I had to fly via Melbourne which was a pain in the neck as we had to disembark in Melbourne and go through a stringent security check again. On take off the cabin crew did not do a safety check of passengers and we took off with one passenger asleep across three seats unrestrained. One passenger had tray table down and that was what I could see from my seat. The cabin crew avoided eye contact at all times. During the long overnight flight from Delhi children were allowed to run amok. Food mediocre. Would never use again. FRA-DEL/DEL-KAT/KAT-DEL-FRA - Were told at check-in in FRA that there was a delay of 1 hour but gate was closed at scheduled time! Waiting time of one full hour in FRA before taking off! No service or drinks for 4 hours during flight. Breakfast served last minute. Crew on all legs not really interested in customer and service. Dreamliner with lot of space and good fresh air full flat beds really comfortable. Food ok but cheese platter served after dessert. Champagne before taking off but no wine offered on return-flight. Flight to Kathmandu and back: time change and delayed return for 1.5 hrs. Service pathetic no smile the only question was \"veg or non veg\" without any \"please\". Air India has to improve service to get competitive. Chennai-Dubai and Dubai-Mumbai a couple of months ago. Old A-321 aircraft with faded seats and no inflight entertainment system. Surly cabin crew who had a feeling that they were doing a favor to passengers. On the Chennai-Dubai sector the passenger sitting in front of me asked for an extra can of beer during dinner only to be roughly ticked off by the cabin crew. The reason given was that they only serve one can of beer per passenger. I have flown hundreds of miles on various airlines but this is the first time that I am hearing such a ridiculous explanation. With this kind of flight experience it is no wonder that most of the traffic on the Gulf routes from India deviates towards the Middle Eastern carriers. First time flying from Melbourne to Delhi and return. Dreamliner is great plane though found on both trips that remote controls were broken. Maintenance seems poor and seats dirty as well as hard though space is good. Very poor staff service and as remotes are broken you can't call attendants - deliberate? Toilets are very dirty and we ran out of toilet tissues. Had to remind staff. No cleaning of toilets as on most other airlines. Staff are lazy. Some exceptions but did not make up for non attentiveness. Could not believe poor movie choice - latest movies were two years old and most between 5-10 years. Issued good headphones but I used my Bose and relied on my own entertainment. We usually left late and the plane system is very poor in showing estimated arrival time. Food was poor. Was expecting some dinner and got served a snack which was terrible. Suspect I picked up Delhi belly on flights as well despite using my own hand cleaner. Will only use them as last resort. There are many better options. Use at your own risk. Took this flight because of convenient timing. Check in was smooth. Surprisingly they started boarding early, more than 1 hour before flight time. Plane was only 3 minutes from the terminal. We got to the plane and thee was no AC, temperature outside was over 40 degrees Celsius (Dubai in July). Passengers were getting very restless and children were crying due to heat. They had us on the plane for a very long time and we ended up leaving late, so more than 1 hour on the plane. AC only went on properly 15 minutes after take off. The aircraft was very very old and dirty. Flight was smooth and crew was friendly. They need to use newer planes, or reconsider. People use this because of timing and non-stop route to Pune. I think if there were better option no one would go on it. Flew from Dubai to Lucknow and back to Dubai. The crew seemed bored and the service was horrible. The table was broken and the meal served was inedible. The toilets were dirty. The seats were uncomfortable which made spending those hours on the aircraft unbearable. Choosing Air India Express was a poor choice in spite of the low cost tag attached to it. FRA-DEL-MUM: 30th Nov 14. Ground staff to aircraft crew were just disinterested. Passengers were greeted by young friendly crew but that's it. Other members clearly were not happy with their jobs. Captains announcement were rather short and straight. Seats still had bread crumbs on them and tables had oily stains this was on a new 787-8. Drinks had restricted choice. Cola or Juice. Food served in aluminium foil was shabbily presented and was overcooked. Crew members never gave service with smile although they did attend when called. Domestic sector was better than international flight. Aircraft was extremely old with tattered carpet and food was again shabbily presented but crew were polite and accommodating. Air India its time to pull up your socks as a part of star alliance passengers will choose to other airlines to your shabby service. Lack of Professionalism was very evident! Apart from having point to point connection there is nothing else that this airline can offer. I flew from Dubai to Amritsar and back and found this trip rather exhausting and uncomfortable due to the airline service. Being a budget carrier does mean to save costs but its doesn't mean to keep your aircraft's dirty and unhygienic. When I entered the aircraft both the times I felt as I am traveling in one of those public buses which are disposed for public use (to be honest even public buses are well maintained that Air India Express aircraft's) the crew looked angry for no reason it felt as if they were punished to come here and serve us they did not have the decency to speak politely with passengers and just dumped their frustration on us. Food was awful as everything looked stale and had no taste. Since this was the only flight available for me to reach Amritsar I was forced to take it. Booked Dubai-Pune-Dubai in Jan 2014 however had to change the Dubai-Pune leg of the journey. My return journey (Pune-Dubai) was a nightmare. On arriving at the airport in the early hours of the morning I realized that my flight had been delayed for reasons unknown/unannounced to me. Then delayed 40 minutes in the security check line because other domestic flights need to be released earlier. After much delay I arrive at the final gate only to see no information displayed about my flight. Its delayed further. No one at any counter to enquire for any information. Felt relieved when the announcement to board was being made but there was more to come we were made to sit inside the aircraft as the pilots did not have clearance from ATC. It turned out to be for an hour or more until we finally were given clearance to fly. So a trip which I chose on purpose to save time and money did everything else but those two things. My return flight from Mumbai to London was via Delhi. The flight departure times of the first leg Mumbai-Delhi (AI809) have been changed 3 times since I booked the flight in September. This has caused so many uncertainties with hotel booking in Mumbai. The final departure time was delayed by 3 hours to 7AM thus making it an uncomfortable morning on the day. To add to the misery when I reached the airport I learnt that the flight is delayed by 2.20 hours. This information was obtained by enquiring the assistance desk - none of the flight status TVs had updated this information. DXB-IXE. Boarded with apprehension but quite pleasantly surprised. Reasonably clean aircraft pleasant crew and food! Not bad for a budget airline and way better than Air India (the so called full service airline). Have flown them a couple of times again on the same sector. I am regular passenger in UAE-Kerala route. Flights seems to be fairly reasonable compared to the fare structure and clean. Crew helpful. But the snacks to be supplied as per the timing. On mid night flights supplying banana chips and cakes really upset the stomach. Any toasted bread sandwiches (veg or non-veg) would be more ideal which will not add up the cost to the airlines. The fare calculation methods seems strange. Sometimes a person buying an online ticket far earlier before 1 or two months pays more than someone take it on the day or previous day of the flight. Also the taxes calculation. More basic fare is with less tax and vice versa. Recently the cancellation charges have been increased to 35% which is really unbearable. It should be reversed to 10% before 10 days and 15% prior to 24 hrs at least. Singapore to Calcutta return. An adequate performance from this budget carrier. The flights were on time the comfort was adequate and the staff generally reasonably friendly. The only slight downside was the quality of food offered in the snackbox - barely edible pastries and deep fried cookies. However the flight is only about 4 hours so having little to eat wasn't a big problem. The tickets were 50% cheaper than the only other carrier to offer non-stop flights on this route (Singapore Air) so overall I was extremely pleased with Air India Express. TRZ to KUL via Chennai return. The aircraft was relatively clean on both sectors. Since this was the only flight to Trichy from Kuala Lumpur I thought it would be more practical to just take this flight since there is no hassle of getting out into Chennai. However the transit procedure in Chennai is terrible. We had to get on bus queue up till everyone got off the plane and go though security check again. For the price you pay the service is not at all worthwhile. I paid INR 13000 on IX flight from Kolkata to Singapore compared to about 21000 in SQ. The aircraft was clean crew reasonably friendly. They served snacks on the flight. I would say if they keep the aircraft clean and maintains time it's good value for money. I would have to fly few more times to see if they are reliable! On October 31 2014 I had the unpleasant experience of traveling from JFK to DEL via Air India - the onboard service was horrendous. I was escorted in the wrong direction on boarding once I eventually got to my seat I waited almost 10 mins for someone to put my jacket away I eventually had to get up and hand the flight attendant my jacket. Very odd odour from the carpet. Requested a special meal 4 weeks in advance it was confirmed but not provided. No menu for dinner and breakfast options flight attendant walked up and down asking veg or non-veg food presentation was below par. On board movie selection was outdated - seat 8H had mechanical failure would not recline. Bathroom were dirty 6 hours into the 14 hour flight. Flight attendants provided wrong immigration paperwork causing delay in DEL. I travelled Sydney-Hyderabad via New Delhi on 16th August 2014 and the flight was delayed by 1.5 hours and I missed my connecting flight to Hyderabad. After 2 hours I was given overnight accommodation and booked in the morning flight to Hyderabad. I had the same bizarre experience on my return flight to Sydney via New Delhi on 23/10/2014. I got a phone call a day before the flight that it has been modified and will leave couple of hours early and will go to Delhi via Vishakhapatnam. The flight from Hyderabad was delayed again by an hour due to check-in system being down which again resulted in me missing my connection to Sydney. There were 8 passengers connecting to Sydney and a notification by the captain was not good enough to save our day. It does not end here at immigration I had my departure stamp and as I was waiting for my wife and kids passports to get stamped when the Air India staff informed us that the flight to Sydney is now closed and we can't board the aircraft. It took another 4 hours to do the paperwork to cancel the departure stamp on my passport. Then the routine of going to hotel and take the flight the next day. There is no sense of customer service or sympathy at this inconvenience. I would make every effort never to fly Air India again. The only good thing about the journey was the plane itself. There is ample legroom the seats are comfortable and the dreamliner 787 windows are dimmed to give night experience. Flight staff service varies person to person - some are good and others indifferent. Overall do not fly Air India if you don't have the buffer time to offset for these delays. I travelled to Bangkok from Delhi on 12th Oct'14. The flight was delayed by 1.5 hours but we somehow managed that delay. My return flight was on 23rd Oct'14 - the flight was delayed by 5 hours. I had to catch next flight (after 2 hours) from Delhi to Lucknow on the same day. I had to literally beg them to transfer me to another flight. I don't understand why Air India flights are always delayed and other airlines are always on time. They have got good aircraft but there attitude towards passengers and time management needs to be improved. I travel Air India 3-4 times a year. This time I was travelling from Delhi (DEL) to Kochi (KOX) on an A320 the seats were not comfortable at all. The TV on the flight was not working. The food was horrible. The Dreamliner flight from Sydney to Delhi was a disappointment. 1) Seats were very cramped. Not adequate leg space for such a long flight. 2) Toilets were dirty and toilet tissues were not replaced. 3) The entire economy seating area smelt. 4) A snack and a drink was very much needed before landing. Just two meals for a 13 hour flight was not adequate. 5) Fruit juice and diet drinks were not available after the first meal service. 6) A wet wipe or steamed towel should have been provided at the end of such along flight. We had to disembark even without being able to freshen up. Definitely not up to international standards. Trying to get to Delhi from Bombay for a 6pm wedding. Our 1pm flight - cancelled till 2.30pm. 2.30pm flight - told at counter it was over-booked and is now full. The next available flight is at 5pm - delayed till 5.20pm without prior notice. 5.45pm - begin takeoff procedures. 5.55pm - electrical failure. Plane comes to a standstill. Lights and AC continue to be switched on and off. 6pm - captain announces \"there has been an electrical failure and out technical team is on their way to trouble-shoot\". No further explanation offered. No beverages offered. If you got up to ask for water they did oblige by giving you one small glass. 6.45pm - herded like animals and packed like sardines onto a stationary bus on the tarmac. When asked what was happening and where we were going we were told \"nowhere. you can not stand on the tarmac so you must sit on the bus and wait while we do final checks onboard. The buses were over-packed and we were locked inside while staff and drivers disappeared. 7.15pm - finally start to re-board passengers. We decide not to get back onto an aircraft that has electrical failures. We demanded our luggage and a full refund. The ground staff obliged however sent us wondering around the airport unescorted in search of the duty manager. This whole process took until 8pm. After 7 hours all delays and cancellations sitting around the airport on the plane on buses and being spoken to in a patronising manner by everyone from ground staff to on-flight staff we did not end up flying to Delhi and we have missed our friends wedding. I will never fly with or recommend Air India. Flying to the Maldives via Mumbai from Ahmedabad on Sept 14th. Checked in and were told flight was on time. We were to have a 5 hour break in Mumbai giving us plenty of time to catch connection on Sri Lanka Airways. The flight never arrived and was 4 hours late taking off although AI personnel insisting we would make our connection. Never did no help from AI personnel in Mumbai and worst experience on a flight ended up in transit at the airport for over 26 hours. I was excited to be travelling on Air India's new 'Dreamliner' from Sydney to Delhi yesterday. The experience fell well short of my expectations. I endeavoured to do on-line check-in but it was not available so I phoned and requested an aisle set. That request was never registered but the check-in assistant in Sydney gave me an exit row seat which I was very happy with. On the flight the entertainment system for my seat 30C was not working. I initially complained but I was dismissed by the first flight attendant and told I would need to wait for it to cut in. After an hour of waiting I approached another flight attendant who assured me he would re-set the system. Following another few failed attempts I was assured that they would register the fact that it wasn't working and that it would fixed for the next passenger. Not sure how that helped me! When it came time for meal- time the flight attendant asked me to pull out my tray and was irritated when I couldn't. The tray was actually broken. She did endeavour to fix it but it remained a problem throughout the flight. Unfortunately the entertainment system appears to control the overhead lighting as well. The result was that I had no access to movies music or reading light for the full flight which is 12 hrs 30 minutes that's a long time to sit in the dark. There was no apology or understanding from staff. The food was very basic with little variety there was minimal genuine service on the flight. Staff seemed to vanish between meals and seemed irritated when a passenger asked for something. If anything I found some of the staff quite rude. This was a very full flight I think staff need to pay some attention to the toilets during the trip. At one stage one of the toilet basins was clogged and another passenger complained to staff. I do a lot of travel and this is the worst flights I have taken. I would endeavour never to fly Air India again but from Sydney to Delhi there is very little choice of operators. Hopefully Air India will develop a true sense of service before my next trip. DEL to GOI via BOM. Tatty old A321 that looked liked it hadn't been properly clean since being brought into service 20 years ago. Washroom basin filthy with brown stains everywhere. Surly crew who were mannerless. Cramped uncomfortable seats. No alcohol or soft drinks available on either legs. Sat on plane at Mumbai whilst plane serviced for 40 minutes - terribly unprofessional ground crew cleaning the plane around you. Flew from Chicago to Delhi the leg room in the airplane was good but its a poorly maintained aircraft. The entire plane was dirty. One of the toilets were not working. The snacks were not served you had to walk to the back of the aircraft to find a sandwich and a drink. Horrible experience. EWR-BOM-AMD. Flight was supposed to depart on 3 July 2014 I flew on 5th July. Everything went well until take off there was a problem with the air-conditioning which was not resolved at all. After 4.5 hours we were told to get off the plane. After getting our baggage we were told to stand in a queue for 40 mins to get hotel vouchers and after getting the voucher I was waited for the hotel transportation for 3 hours. We were 54 passengers and there was only 1 bus which could carry 34 passengers. Back to the airport for 11 am next day told to stand in line for another flight which was at 4 pm on 4 July 2014. After standing in line for 4 hours I was told the flight was full and another was scheduled for 8. Boarded the flight and after 2 hrs we were told that there was problem with the engine and it took them another 4 hours to decide that we had to get off the plane again another motel was given. Spoke to a manager of Air India and they got me on 5th July's AI 190 EWR-BOM-AMD flight. Finally on 5th July I arrived home 72 hours late. I have decided not to fly Air India in the future. My husband and I took Air India from Kolkata to Singapore. Our domestic flight was good but the international flight was horrible. We were given different seats no blankets were provided and the food was cold and very small in quantity. Even the inflight entertainment was zero as nothing was working in order. Whole journey we suffered a lot. Travelled by AI to HYD. Aircraft was VT-SCB in the Indian livery. Plus points: Check in was a breeze. Flight departed on time. Minus points: Aircraft was unclean. Crumbs on the tray table the side panels looked as if the last time they had been cleaned was during the Airbus delivery. All that pax were given was 2 cheap pieces of biscuit. The spring rod from the seat pocket was broken and was poking my knee on for the entire flight. For a full flight I did not have an option to change my seat. Never again with Air India. The service offered was very poor. There was no entertainment at all. I travelled from Hyderabad to Delhi. The duration of flight is two hours. Service was unavailable during the entire journey. The food was not at all good. Bangkok to Mumbai. We were travelling along with family. Horrible flight. Travelling period was 4 hours 30 min. Entertainment system was not working at all. Staff on the board was not cooperative. It was a horrible experience. Travelled 11th April 2014 was very disappointed with the delay we faced at LHR 6 hours delay due to technical problems with the new dreamliner 787. Not happy with leg space I was expecting something a bit more sophisticated not nice experience for those who are broad and tall. Had problems with entertainment system on the way to DEL and on the way back to LHR crew were friendly. Sorry Air India but first and last. We flew from Bhopal to Delhi. Our international flight had a baggage limit of 25 kg however the limit on this flight was 15 kg. We were therefore way over the limit. We were taken away to a small room and made to feel like criminals. We had to pay a significant fine and were ignored when we tried to explain our situation. The whole situation was handled very unprofessionally and as a result we will certainly not use Air India in the future. My family of 4 2 adults and 2 children traveled Dubai-Goa-Dubai on 20th Feb to 8 March on Air India direct. On 20th Feb Dubai-Goa the flight was scheduled at 11pm but took off at 12.20am. The delay announcement was very brief and no one was available at the gate for comments. If passengers were told even at 7-8pm in the evening it would have avoided rushing to the airport. Food specially for children could be managed by us etc. We were left standing as there was nowhere available to sit. No entertainment onboard the seat in the front had a torn pocket which had a wire coming out which could be very dangerous for my child. I had ordered a children's meal however on the flight back on 8th March none was given. When we pay a similar fare compared to other flights why can we not get the same services? Its been 20 years since I flew Air India and absolutely nothing has changed - the airline is still awful. I took a short hop DEL-JAI and a 40 minute flight turned into a 3 hour ordeal. Arrived DEL airport and check in staff said flight was on time. Went to gate and no plane or agent to ask questions. Told by uninterested ground staff flight was changed to different gate. Went to new gate and waited for 90 minutes and finally asked what time boarding would begin. Told flight was delayed by 1 hour due to late arrival of incoming aircraft - no announcements no information nothing. Ground crew stood around chatting on their cell phones as passengers got annoyed and angry. Finally boarded 90 minutes late and hustled into seats. After 30 captain says airport at JAI Is closed waited another 60 minutes then abruptly push back fro gate. Flight to JAI uneventful crew had a few smiles. AI 301 3 Feb 2014. Flew MEL-DEL. Chose Air India as it has a direct connection Delhi-Chandigarh. A friend was raving about the new Dreamliner. End up disappointed. Nothing special other than the fancy lighting on its windows and interior. The remote did not work thank goodness for touch screen TV. Food choice was either veg or non veg only both Indian cuisine. Portion was small ended up asking for a snack 3 hours after lunch was served. Cabin was messy by end of flight too many children on board unfortunately. Good points: Cabin staff were attentive to requests. The female crew uniforms are an old style definitely need a modern design. Also ground support staff were very good to ensure elders all received wheelchair support. I have used Air India for my 2 trips in 6 months for Sydney-Delhi flight. Even though planes are new and spacious with good legroom unfortunately 6 month old planes are falling apart too quickly components are broken in toilets inflight entertainment remote broken water seeping out of toilets on carpets service light not working or erratic tray tables dirty with no effort to collect rubbish during or at end of flight. Entertainment: Not much to watch / listen. Food: Nothing exciting again. If you are lucky to take off on time you will get a quick round of drinks. Staff will whack the meal on your tray table. As soon as meals are served you will see cabin crew coming at 100 miles/hr with tea / coffee pots. Next cabin crew are back with trolleys to collect your trays even though half of the plane is still finishing their meals. Staff: Pilots: No updates / Announcements. Cabin Crew are uninterested uncaring and rude. Overall hopeless and frustrating airline. I recently flew on the MAA-DEL-SYD leg. At Chennai airport for an A320 flight they had only 3 operating check-in counters whilst planes from other airlines had 5-6 counters. This led to long delays and lengthy queues. The Air India ground staff at New Delhi airport seemed to be helpful in helping the passengers getting to their connecting flights. The Dreamliner for the Delhi - Sydney leg seemed to be a good one. The flight was delayed by 3 hours due to 3 stewards reporting sick at the last moment and they had to bring in replacement crew. The announcements were spotty and not easily forthcoming. The food served was tiny in portion with only one round of drinks offered for a 12.5 hour journey. The IFE was limited but worked. The toilets didn't have any amenities for a long-haul flight. The punctuality and the unreliability of this airline would make one say never again. AI 332 DEL-BKK. AI lounge in DEL is fine but just don't expect too much non-Indian cuisine. Terrible wifi with a very confusing sign-up process. Showers working clean and enjoyed after connecting flight from LHR. Final call made to rush passengers on board only to be met with a massive queue in the various walkway bridges so not the best first impression. A321 business class seats were good and the way business class seats should be - real business class seats and not 'adapted economy' ones. Cabin crew definitely surly however once smiled at they immediately smile back. Drinks service was fine however only given a packet of French-fry style crisps seemed a bit amateur for executive class. My pre-ordered gluten-free meal left the crew somewhat perplexed and I was met with the response \"veg or no veg\" as an option. 'No veg' was nice enough however the chicken main contained only 3 small chunks of meat. The IFE was not on demand and the cabin was very hot and stuffy throughout most of the flight. We arrived in BKK early however there wasn't a single landing card to be found on the plane which quickly cancelled out any early arrival gains! Chicago to Delhi in First class. The ticket cost almost 2x business class in a European carrier but I chose it due to the direct nature of the non-stop flight. What a mistake. The first class product is very poor seats uncomfortable and felt like sitting on a metal rod. Cabin service was pathetic with a poor choice of drinks and food. And most shocking is Air India has stopped giving toiletry bags. If you are going to fork out the money do it on Qatar or British Airways. Singapore to Amritsar with a transit in Delhi. The domestic flights were much better than the international flights in every aspect. Upon check-in the officials insisted that our luggage had to be checked out in Delhi and checked in again when the final destination for the luggage was clearly stated as Amritsar on the luggage tags. The same happened on our way back. My 83-year-old grandmother was with me and she has difficulty walking so we requested for a wheelchair for her. Due to this we were the last to get off so that my grandmother had more time and could get off slowly. When we landed in Delhi from Singapore for transit there was a delay in bringing in the wheelchair and the female flight attendant who was apparently in a hurry to get off told my grandmother to walk out and wait outside the plane for the wheelchair. Domestic flight attendants showed more care and were very accommodating towards my grandmother. In-flight entertainment was not working to Delhi and there was no in- flight entertainment to Singapore on the old plane which was quite run-down. Our flight to Singapore from Delhi was on 16th Dec 12.05am and we landed in Delhi on 15th Dec after 4pm for transit. When we tried to enter the international airport the security officials refused to let us in asking us to come back 24 hours later as the date written on our boarding pass was 16th Dec. They refused to listen when we explained our flight was 5mins after midnight. We went to the Air India customer service counter where there were other passengers with the same problem. She simply told us to keep our boarding pass and show them our booking confirmation instead which we did and the security did not accept. The customer service officer refused to come out of her counter and speak to the security officials for us. We managed to enter the airport 3 hours later. We also had to request for wheelchair assistance again and the customer service officer told us to wait while she went to get the wheelchair. After making us wait for 40 mins she returned with 2 cups of coffee and no wheelchair. Upon entering the international airport there was a whole new problem with the Air India officials. On reaching Singapore we realised that there was no communication within Air India for the wheelchair assistance. The air stewardess instead told us off that we should have requested for assistance earlier which we did repeatedly. Overall the experience with them was horrible as they created inconvenience for us every step of the way but certainly eye-opening to see that their service could be of this standard. I was travelling on an executive class ticket on flight AI 047 from Kochi to Delhi on 9th Dec was disgusting. A very old A320 in all economy configuration. Cabin smelt of stale sweat and was incredibly hot. Of 3 toilets one was shut up with packing tape and looked like it had been for some time. The other 2 were filthy and stank of urine by the time we got to Delhi the floor of the front one had been covered in newspaper to soak up 'liquid'. At least on 3rd class Indian Railways you would not have had windows! My seat had a table located in the armrest it and its housing were filthy. The other armrest had a liftable cover and filled with food scraps and wrappers. Complaints to crew onboard and on the Delhi transfer desk were met with shrug and ignoring you. Flight 114 from Birmingham was not so great 3.5 hrs late. Departure time was 5.30pm but departed at 9.40pm. When we were boarding the plane looked great however upon take off there were problems. They did not have any vegetarian dishes they came back with bread rolls and butter for the rest of the flight. When we got to Delhi we were delayed a further 4hrs due. Poor flight and service. Newark-Mumbai in Business Class on a Boeing 777-300ER. The quality of Business class on Air India has really deteriorated. No amenity kits no menus no choice (sorry but \"veg\" or \"non-veg\" in business class is not very business class) presentation no better than economy class and even the quality of the offerings terrible. IFE offerings limited and one side of the cabin the IFE stopped working and the crew couldn't rejig it. On the plus side the cabin crew were polite helpful and considerate and the flat bed seats very comfortable. Air India needs to get back to basics and retrain staff what a miserable bunch. I have flown three times with them and there is not one good thing I can say about the flights. The last flight and it will be the last we travelled from Mumbai/Delhi/Singapore all that can be said about it was that we left and arrived on time. I decided that a fitting end to our stay in India would be to spend a couple of days at the Taj Hotel Mumbai we have done so for two years what a magic end to our India journey. But it wasn't the end - I had to endure the Air India flight and that left a nasty taste in our mouths. Dubai to Goa worst aircraft I have travelled on dirty scruffy broken parts. How can Air India be a National Airline? Inflight entertainment poor food poor flight attendants abysmal. Third world airline. I have been hearing horror stories about Air India and my recent trip proved that they are true. Travelled SHJ-COK on AI934 on 1st November. AI used 20 year old A320 (VT-ESH) with pealed off panels rattling windows and to make the journey worse there was no water in the toilets. Cabin crew were in no mood to work at all and after the food was served they ignored the calls from the passengers for service and were busy chatting to each other. This was the worst flight I ever had since my first flight in 1998 and I will never travel Air India again. I took Air India to Singapore and transit via two domestic airports at Kolkata and Chennai in October 2013. Aircraft's was dirty and old the seats were spoilt and not cleaned. The cabin crew were unfriendly. What was worst is that the co-ordination between Air India check in counter and the airport departure notifications were repeatedly inconsistent in all my connecting flights causing many confusion and at one connecting flight I was almost late and got reprimanded openly and loudly by the staff when I was already racing to the different gate (that was on a different floor from that indicated on the Kolkata airport terminal). Disappointing I had thought that this is a state airline and was anticipating better service. One of the worst airlines I have ever flown with. Although I've flown with the new Dreamliner from Delhi to Frankfurt the aircraft was in a disappointing condition. The cleanliness was poor the crew was rude incompetent and not very service oriented. At least the flight was cheap. Flew from Bangalore to Goa - Flight delayed an hour but we were called and informed in advance. Aircraft was cramped. No entertainment considering the flight was going onwards to Dubai. The women crew were old and clumsy. No greeting while clearing trays. I really don't know why the even bother serving anything - two tiny biscuits and lukewarm tea. On the return flight was better more comfortable limited entertainment. Flight from Goa to Bangalore went via Pune and Hyderabad - small packet of peanuts and soft drink until Pune from Pune to Hyderabad two tiny biscuits and lukewarm tea and from Hyderabad to Bangalore - 2 biscuits and lukewarm coffee. This is supposed to be a full service airline! Would rather pay less and fly a low cost airline in future. AI112 from London to Delhi on AI112. The worst journey. The TV wasn't working lights were not working call button was not working and air hostesses were rude. AI331 9 Aug BKK-BOM A321 Seat: 29f. Cabin crew greeted us in a most \"welcoming\" way with her right arm resting on the galley and the other hand resting on her hip. Mid way INTO THE cabin 1 male steward WAS standing with both arms folded atop a seat - with a blank expression. Settling into my seat I instantly notice that there is more legroom than other airlines. Then no push back for 45 minutes no reason given no information. After 50 minute we pushed back suddenly and took off without any checks that seats were upright or seatbelts. 1 hour into the flight a drink service starts and then pause 1 hour later the meal service starts. Asked if I wanted \"veg or non veg\" I had ordered voml (oriental vegan) told to wait until they had finished. 3 hrs into the flight when all have finished eating the stewardess walks past me suddenly remembers and asks \"did you like it\" and I reply \"well I haven't got it yet so I cant comment on the taste\". He runs to the galley and is back with a \"kosher meal box\". AI330 16 Aug BOM-BKK was less eventful but nothing better. I've always been a staunch TG loyal but thought this 1 time I must try my National Airline - it is the last time. Business class from Singapore to Paris via Delhi. I've had better economy seats than these business class seats from Singapore to Delhi. Exit row seats would have been better. Plus both my wife's and my video screens didn't work both ways. Half an hour after getting boarding passes plane took off late and we missed our connecting flight to Paris. They put us in hotel and that was it. No further communication or anything. Stuck in airport (smaller than domestic) for 24 hours. More employees than passengers walking around the terminal but nothing gets done. Make a request or ask a question and they smile and every answer is yes but nothing is ever done about it. Got on plane next day and delayed 90 minutes. Missed 26 hours of Paris to look at Delhi airport that has about 10-15 shops. No alcohol in the business lounge. The new Dreamliners from Delhi to Paris are the only redeeming feature. Never again. Of the last 4 trips I spent almost as much time delayed by Air India than I did flying by Air India. Goa-Chennai delay 4 hours flight time 1.5 hours Chennai-Singapore delay time 30 mins Flight time 4 hours Singapore-Chennai delay time 5 hours flight time 4 hours Chennai Goa delay time 0 hours Flight time 1.5 hours. In all: delay time 9.5 hours Flight time 11 hours. Then I had to put up with the service. BOM-SIN. Very limited service in Business Class. Meal the same in Business as Economy. Staff mainly stayed in the front of the aircraft sitting behind a curtain. Very dated plane. Worst Business Class of any airline that I have flown on. DEL-SIN-DEL. I flew through Air India 380/381. Delhi to Singapore and return. The air hostess' behaviour was not at all professional. They had smiling faces towards First class Passengers though. After that they ran out of blankets so they increased the temperature. The food was wet due to too much condensation and they forgot to mention that the entertainment system was down. LHR-DEL-KOL and back. Staff were helpful and I did get a seat with extra legroom on one sector. I don't find this airline good. Toilets are not kept clean during the flight. There were no seat covers on any flight sector. Problems with website on smart phone many options simply don't work. Online check in was therefore not possible for me. My seat area also wasn't up to Western standards of cleanliness. There is no menu for food. 'Continental chicken Indian lamb or Indian vegetarian' isn't really enough info. Drinks selection is very limited. Only one beer choice only 4 spirits (no rum). Entertainment: Of the 10 buttons on my console 5 were ripped out and so using the console was tricky. TV selection doesn't exist at all if your language is English movie selection is very limited. Games are so badly produced they are not fun to play at all. The inflight entertainment system is about where it should have been 15-20 years ago. I flew LHR-DEL return in Business Class both ways and was distinctly unimpressed. My ticket was bought for me so I did not have a choice other than Air India. Other than the fact there was a flat bed seat everything else was pretty mediocre. Other than being served on china the meals were economy class standard complete with clingfilm wrap and yoghurt that was 4 days past its sell by date. There were 4 or 5 English- language movies in total but the TV choice was extremely poor - only Hindi language. Cabin crew were friendly but pretty useless - repeated requests for things that only came the 4th time of asking. Given who is up against Air India on this route I definitely would not choose Air India again nor recommend them to anyone. To and from Kathmandu via New Delhi. I would never use this airline again. The planes are cramped and uncomfortable the seat booking arrangements are chaotic and staff seemed unable or unwilling to explain what the problems were. We had problems both on the outwards and return trips. I had pre-booked seats online - do not do this as it causes all sorts of problems which the airport systems seem unable to override. For example when we asked to change to extra legroom seats at the airport in Kathmandu - we were given a boarding card for the Delhi-London flight but in fact our seats had been cancelled - as we discovered when we came to board. We were bumped off the flight and forced to spend a night in transit hotel limbo. This might have been fine if we had known what was happening and been kept informed but the staff kept us standing like idiots by the boarding gates while they went into huddles over the computer - for hours! LHR-DEL-ATQ. Main flight from London to Delhi was horrible plane had worn carpets and out of date seats most airlines now have better leg room and inflight entertainment. Food was minuscule portions and unrecognisable. Would not bother flying them in the future. Flew AI in November 2012 LHR-DEL-CCU return (AI112 A20 AI21 AI111). Check in swift generous baggage allowance. Flight was an hour late hence didn't cause much of a stir. In-flight decor seating etc.- appalling! Torn carpets and upholstery tired interiors poor lighting creaky and cramped seats poor back support made for a low comfort ride. Ground staff and in-flight staff - were excellent. Inflight entertainment: fair with a bias towards Indian programmes. Meals provided on LHR-DEL could certainly do with improvement arrived in sterile plastic containers cold not fresh. It certainly did not qualify as a wholesome 'Indian treat'. In contrast meals served on DEL-CCU-DEL-LHR were fresh full of flavour. Baggage handling: can do with improvement. Overall they did a good job with honest pricing of tickets and generous baggage allowances with room for improvement in some departments. My wife and I flew non-stop from Chicago to Delhi. Left on January 22 and returned on January 30 on Boeing 777-300ER. Our seats were very hard and uncomfortable my backrest evidently lost it's memory and refused to stay in the upright position front seat pocket was partially glued together with a disgustingly big wad of chewing gum the inner plastic window insert kept rattling in unison with the jet engines. Coffee was the absolute worse I have tasted flight staff were good. It got us there and it got us back home. Business class from Singapore to Delhi on an A319 and it's was fairly basic. The seats are old and not that comfortable - leg room is ok though. Service from the cabin crew - nothing to get excited about either. They were quite stoic did their basic job and then sat (slept) on the forward jumpseat the rest of the flight. There was a breakfast service (the food was not bad) but they never came through an offered anything else - - nothing. The economy class had a second beverage service - but if you wanted something extra in business class - you had to ring your call button and then they would reluctantly come out of the galley. The inflight entertainment is very basic too - all Indian movies. We flew LHR to Mumbai and on to Goa and return via Delhi. Flights were cheap and therefore I agree that they were value for money. Most of the inflight entertainment didn't seem to work across the cabin or the films packed up. The seats were possibly the most uncomfortable I have encountered they were narrow and the cushions non existent and the toilets smelt. The crew were friendly and attentive on the way out but appeared infrequently on the way back. Food on both flights was horrible. I wish we had paid more and gone with another carrier. BKK-DEL-KTM-BKK in business class. BKK-DEL airplane old seats are old no footrest. Toilet reeks of moth balls served same food as in coach in foil container. KTM-DEL-BKK same old plane asked for a blanket and received a used and stained one. No Ice on board no Immigration form on board no fast track offered. Had Non veggie continental and they served me cold spaghetti Bolognese. Poor service is one problem but biggest problem with their staff. Flight AI 317 19 Nov HKG to DEL-BOM. This deals with the 777 service HKG to DEL. Flight was inbound from Seoul and even though we saw the plane for 2 hours + at the gate we were still late. Security boarding was extensive and a joke. Seat was broken but was found another. Flight attendants were grumpy. When we finally took off bar service started with tray table unceremoniously taken out in front of you with a bang. You had to have a drink no question. Then the food came. Was told prawn curry or vegetarian. No menu. No choice. It all came on 1 tray. Flight had not been provisioned correctly so 1/3 of business class got economy meals. Seat went back all the way to horizontal so I slept but cabin was freezing. Arrived in Delhi late. Disembarking the galley floors were flooded/cluttered which was awful. Transfer to connecting flight was badly handled. AVOD was a joke. It was very complicated and a choice of all of 4 new films. AI381 SIN-DEL delayed two hours due to a late inbound flight (but notification email sent under three hours before scheduled departure by which time I was already en route to Changi). An unaccommodating seat in a dated (if less than half-full) A320 was only marginally less disappointing than a breakfast service at which I was offered Fanta owing to a lack of regular juices. Given the low occupancy rate one might have expected service to have been more prompt and attentive. Instead the boisterous cabin crew decided to occupy the empty rows towards the rear and chatter amongst themselves while the passengers were left without IFE in a dimmed cabin. What you pay for is what you get. 14th September 2012 from Bangkok to London with a stop over in Delhi. First leg of the trip was a 4.5hour journey to Delhi and was the worst flight I have taken. After sitting down I realised my TV was not working I asked the flight attendant if this would rectify itself on take off and he told me to 'sit down and wait'. After take off my TV started up and I could only watch one English film which was half way through probably from the flight before. We landed in Delhi and after two hours boarded a better plane with bigger seats and bigger TV screens. The inflight entertainment was average but I could cope with that rude and lazy flight attendants I cannot. Not long after take off the trays of food come round. The curry was really nice shame the lady serving me was the complete opposite. After my meal I waited 20 minutes for a flight attendant when I wanted a drink after another 10-20minutes I got up and went to ask for a red wine. Who pays £700 for a long haul flight and has to serve themselves? The remainder of the flight was the same. 9.5hours with no flight attendants no-one answering the flight attendant button. Unfortunately I have to fly back to Bangkok with Air India. BKK-DEL segment. There was only 3 of us in Business class. The cabin looked tired food was sub par No drinks were offered and the entertainment system didn't work. There was 2 other flight attendants in the business class who didn't bother to step out they only did when they needed to get to their luggage to transfer some personal belongings. They then left the luggage on the floor for the duration of the flight as well as when landing. I flew from US on Asiana business class and Air India management/flight attendants could learn from them as to how customer service is supposed to be performed. My husband and I flew from Kathmandu Nepal to Varanasi. We boarded about 2 hours late and after keeping us inside the plane for 30 minutes they simply said that there was a problem with the engine and we had to get off (no apologies no explanations). They packed us into a run-down bus parked in front of the aircraft and without any further explanation we sat for 2 hours. Almost 4 hours after our departure time we were simply led back into the plane. Arrived 5 hours late in Varanasi. Staff attitude terrible. PNQ-GOI in Economy. Flight was on time check-in efficient with friendly ground staff. Served snacks and drinks by a friendly crew on the rather short flight. On the negative side: cabin was dirty with torn and worn- out seats. My seat consisted of a big crater-like hole and was very inconvenient. DEL-DXB on an A330-200. There was no personal television and shared TV's were not in a good condition. The toilets smelt and there was a shortage of vegetarian food so I did not eat anything. The crew was co- operative but had limited English skills. I will never fly Air India again Emirates is much better. Hong Kong to Seoul on a Boeing 777-300 - had 2 check-in counters open for the entire flight. Took me an hour just to get to the check-in line and all I had was carry-on items. After boarding and finding my seat I discovered my assigned seat with a used blanket and pillow and a used water bottle stuffed in the seat pocket in front of me. Along with stains on the seat in front of me and dirt and grime covering the fold out table. The floor alongside the cabin walls were covered in dirt and trash and the plastic shielding for many of the seat parts were cracked. I tried to find reprieve in another seat but the rest of the cabin was in similar condition. Worst flight I have ever taken. DEL-IXU via Bhubaneshwar. Both flights were on time on a CRJ 700. Naturally comfort factor comes down to zero. No IFE and almost nil leg space. Seats are cramped and offer almost no push back. Meals were served well and decent keeping in mind that airlines in India are all trying to do away with the catering concept entirely. The ticket prices are quite stiff for this route and yet there is no business class on this aircraft. Its a small plane that can accommodate only 70 passengers. I have been flying Air India for a while but this experience will make me think before buying a ticket for another flight. When you are flying for 4 hours and paying a high price you certainly wish for a comfortable journey. BKK-DEL. Only one food option. Seats almost do not recline entertainment screens are faulty flight info unavailable or not working no paper towels in WC. They did not distribute immigration forms onboard causing a delay later on during immigration formalities. A321 a wrong jet for a 5-hour flight. LHR-DEL-BKK economy. I flew Air India for its generous 35kg baggage allowance. LHR-DEL 777 had tired seats with ironmongery sticking into my back but seats are spacious and many were unoccupied so plenty of room. Inflight entertainment - seat-back screens worked intermittently and the neighbouring seat had buttons missing from the controller. Choice of non-Indian movies very limited anyway. Plane held at the gate for about an hour after 21.30 scheduled departure and no attempt made to serve drinks. Drinks eventually served 2 hrs 40mins into the flight. No wine with the meal. Chicken curry was excessively greasy. Breakfast coming into DEL was also poor. Indian airports offer tediously repetitive security checks at different points and DEL-BKK was delayed 1 hr 20mins. After boarding we waited at the gate for another 40 mins whilst passengers from a delayed flight straggled on. The Airbus looked pretty tired but seats were more comfortable again not overly busy and service was somewhat better on this flight with water offered frequently. Drink service was limited again. Dinner was better quality than LHR and tasty but tiny portions were disappointing. They didn't seem to make up any time on this flight so although I'd allowed 3 hrs for my transfer to domestic in BKK I missed my connection. Timekeeping was consistently poor DEL is a series of queues cabin service was disinterested the planes are relatively new but shabby food and entertainment lacking - and the tickets are expensive. I flew to Kuala Lumpur and back and hated both flights. I'm 6 foot tall, and I usually go in a window seat and I am fine. I was on the aisle seat for both flights and found my legs crammed in. My seat wouldn't recline and found it impossible to find a comfortable position. The plane was too cold, I shivered on the plane and can only be grateful I wasn't allocated a middle or window seat. If you are over 6 feet, 183cm tall, don't expect a pleasant experience. Only good thing was the staff were absolutely fine. Air Asia India: Traveled from Delhi to Bangalore on May 23rd. One of the worst experiences I have had. We boarded the flight which was scheduled to depart at 5.25 pm but due to some technical reasons they returned from the runway and had to change the plane at the last moment. As a result the flight got delayed by almost 3 hours. Next surprise was that they did not offer complementary food considering everybody was just sitting in the plane for 3 hours. When some of us asked the reply was that they are not carrying sufficient food for everyone. The crew was inexperienced. They had no idea about how to handle the situation. I think Air Asia should focus on the quality of services before expanding their network. Flew recently from Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur. Flight was delayed 2 hours. Notification when I was already on my way to the airport. Also cheap is something else with all the add ons you end up paying double to the advertised price. Had better experiences with Lionair / Tigerair for flights in Asia. No space in the aircraft and a small water costs 3$. My flight was from Sydney to Kuala Lumpur on 30 March 2015 at 11.55am. At about 10.30am we were told the flight would leave 2.5 hours late. (We didn't board until after 3pm). Many of us would miss connecting flights I was told that I would be informed about my new connection in Kuala Lumpur. We arrived just after 9pm we handed our boarding passes and were told to wait. After an hour we were given boarding passes for our next flights and were told we had to collect our baggage to go to a hotel. We waited for an hour with our luggage then went through immigration and customs and left the airport to wait for a bus to our hotel. After midnight some of us started to realise that the promised hotel rooms were non-existent and went inside to be in the air conditioning. (We hadn't had food or water served for about five hours by this time.) One staff member yelled at people who were reluctant to leave again to wait for the hotel bus and security were called when one passenger started to complain loudly. A group of passengers were taken to a hotel and returned to our group outside the airport after an hour because they couldn't get them rooms. AirAsia staff then left us. I for example waited 12 hours outside the airport with all my luggage; I had no Malaysian currency to buy food because I was only in transit. No one offered me a food or drink voucher and not one AirAsia staff member apologised. Apparently this level of service is acceptable. I would never book with them again as it's a false economy: you might save a few dollars upfront but if something goes wrong AirAsia takes no corporate responsibility and you are on your own. Fly drive Mukdahan - KOP - DMK. Poor service at check in. Bag overweight so had to pay extra. No problem. Went to service desk to pay. Lady started to serve my wife and then dealt with someone at the next window already being served and ignored us. Flight cramped compared to Nok Air. Drive was fine and on time from Mukdahan. Plane to DMK a little late. As I write this my wife is trying to get home from Bali. They promoted their new direct flight from Melbourne to Bali late last year which we booked only to be told two days before departure that they never had authorisation for that route. As a result she had to travel through KL and this added an extra 8 hours to her trip. They promised that the issue of the direct flight would be fixed before her return trip and guess what. Another text two days before she returns home saying that she is going through KL again. Then the morning of coming home the Flight to KL was cancelled and she was put on an earlier flight meaning she had to leave her hotel in a mad rush at 4am to get to the airport. In total it will now take her 16 hours to get from Bali to Melbourne with this joke of a so called airline. Add to that the customer service is poor the planes are dirty and they promise things they have no intention of delivering. Never again. KUL-HKT-KUL. I accept that if you don't pay to choose a seat it will be selected randomly. But to split people up on the same booking (my wife was in the row behind me) is ridiculous. Outward flight 15 minutes late (it appeared that someone's bag was being offloaded so maybe someone failed to board the flight) before arriving into the chaos of Phuket airport arrivals (I reviewed this airport separately). Flew with them this week between Bangalore Chandigarh and back to Bangalore. I feel the airline has potential if handled properly. The ground staff leave a lot to be desired. Our flight from Bangalore although boarded on time the crew could not clear for quite a while. Pilot seemed to take each thing at a time effecting delay. The return leg was further confusion as fog delayed the incoming flight but no one was interested to let the passengers know the same. No announcements. Also in the aircraft the crew just forgot to ask all to switch off the phones. If it is not much of a problem then why push for it all other times. Where is the safety when the announcements were not completed. No smoking announcement not made. Some positives though. Good pricing strategy. Fresh aircraft and good potential if staff improve. I needed to get to Bangkok Chiang Mai and Krabi. To do this within my allotted time span I had no alternative but to fly between these cities. The price differential is quite marked so I elected to try Air Asia which would allow me to compare it with Bangkok Airways who I had flown with before. The aircraft was configured as a single cabin. The first few rows sported cotton covers over the seat headrest and were reserved for passengers willing to pay a premium. The other seats were so close together that for any person over five feet six inches (like myself) were forced into a painful contortion to avoid digging their knees into the seat-back in front. Minutes after the aircraft departed the four cabin crew members wasted no time in blocking the aisles with trolleys flogging drinks and snacks followed quickly by the same four trying their best to get passengers to buy mementoes of Air Asia. My next flight (Chiang Mai to Krabi) due to depart at 12 noon was cancelled. Its replacement was rescheduled to depart at 5.30pm. This meant a totally wasted day for me and meant arriving at my pre-booked hotel at 9pm instead of 3pm. No apologies – no explanations from Air Asia. The only consistency being the aircraft seating configurations and 2 hours of discomfort instead of one. More of the same on my last flight so there is little point in relating it. All in all my experiences were certainly negative ones. November 26th Chiang Mai to Hong Kong. Early morning flight (departure time 06.00) and while the standard check- in for international flights is 3 hours prior to departure time the counter failed to be staffed until 04.20. A small irritant yes but it was a harbinger of things to come. Ticketing and luggage handling pretty typical of any other airlines with the exception of dealing with excess baggage. Each bag is weighed and there is no leeway whatsoever. Every increment of one kilo was billed as excess baggage. They do not make this easy. The passenger must leave the queue walk across the terminal to the Air Asia cashier process the necessary transaction and then return to the ticket agent to complete the process. We knew we had excess weight we had pre-purchased an additional 20 kilos of sporting equipment. The agent unilaterally decided that trekking equipment was not sporting equipment therefore it was to be classified as excess baggage. We were forced to pay an additional 5575 baht (approximately 175.00 USD) simply based on his arbitrary determination. We pre-ordered and prepaid for an inflight meal. Their idea of a breakfast meal is a small tin of rice or noodles and a 4 oz. cup of water. It was the worst attempt at a meal I have ever witnessed. On this trip we used 10 different airlines. Did Air Asia get us to Hong Kong on time? Yes. Was the plane clean? Yes. Did we receive value for the money spent? Not even close. Of all the airline companies we flew was AirAsia at least average? Not even close! Would we ever fly this company again knowing now how they treat their customers? I hope we never are faced with that decision. AirAsia Philippines is the worst airline I have ever flown with we were flying from Cebu to Manila and back. The boarding process was a disaster with everybody wanting to go in at the same time and nobody tried to even control the flow of passengers. At check in they managed to put our daughter 8 years old in a different row than the parents. On the way back they managed to put our 2 children (5 and 8 years old) in row 6 and the parents in row 26. For a fee they could change seats - this is not normal in my eyes and it would have been normal to put us all in one row. The person who checked us in acted as if he was tired and doing all he could. We flew from Denpasar to Perth yesterday and will never fly this airline again. We checked in several hours before our flight and were disappointed to find that we had been given seats in two different rows (my husband and I were flying with our two kids). Obviously we had hoped to sit together as a family but thought \"oh well it's not the end of the world\". We boarded the plane and realised that we were not only in different rows but in 4 different seats. We were absolutely gob-smacked that an airline could put a 2 year old on his own! When we waved down the air hostess and explained that our son who had just turned two could not sit on his own she told us that the flight was full and we would have to take our dedicated seats. I told her that our 2 year old could not possibly sit on his own and she suggested that he sit on my lap instead. Pretty disappointing when you paid for 4 seats. Just when I thought things couldn't get much worse the food trolley came around and after placing my order for a hot meal for myself and my two kids I was told that they only accept cash and not card. I didn't have any cash on me (I had actually tried to withdraw cash at the airport but the ATM was out of order) so they told me I was unable to order any food. I said that there must be some other option as my kids were hungry and surely there was something they could do but they did not help at all. My poor kids basically spent the whole flight crying with hunger and they wouldn't even give me a bottle of water (as our water had been taken off us at the airport by security). I was basically in tears by this time and finally a kind passenger gave me $10 so I could buy something for the kids to eat. I will never fly with this airline again. Delayed for almost 20 hours without food water and accommodation in Kansai airport. It was a midnight flight. No announcements to update status until 3 hours after departure time. Handled the exit and collection of luggage in a messy manner. Worst airline that io have ever taken. Unprofessional and doesn't care about passengers. Only having profit in mind. Didn't even care for passenger carrying sleeping child. They have to queue in a messy manner to collect departure card from AirAsia ground crew. Unpleasant Experience - flying with toddler with Air Asia. I flew with my wife and 4-year-old son from Jakarta to Singapore on 12 Sep 2014. Surprisingly three of us were assigned to three different seats in three different rows. I asked the check-in counter officer to change the seats. However he said that the flight was full and suggested I purchase seats in advance on my next flights. Some thoughts on this incident: 1) Is this Air Asia business model? Separating a toddler from his/her parents could PUSH the parents to purchase seats on the next flight. This is shown as an ads on AirAsia magazine. 2) Is safety Air Asia's concern? Separating a toddler from his/her parents raises a safety risk. Suppose an emergency event occurs. Who will help the toddler? Do you think a stranger sitting next to him/her would help him/her? Finally I exchanged seats with other passengers. This definitely causes unpleasant for them. After this incident I do not recommend a family with young children to fly with Air Asia unless they want to purchase seats. Boarding was delayed 2 hours because of the incoming flight. This was ok we received vouchers. We boarded the airplane and just after the safety instructions we where informed that there was a problem with an engine. So we waited a further hour when we were informed that we had to disembark. So about 300 passengers left the airport received a coupon and started to queue at the 1 shop to get some food. After an hour of queuing the shop stopped serving claiming that they had run out of food and that we had to go to the other side of security zone to get some food. So we where directed to another queue which turned out to lead to a security check which took away all the fluids that we had bought and returned us exactly where we had started. We queued again to the shop. After an hour the police came and said we had to vacate the area. In both cases an Air Asia representative should have taken the trouble to inform us of what was going on. So then we had a further 3 queues each taking more than an our to pass passport control get hotel vouchers and board busses. Air Asia obviously does not care about our holiday time because if they had they would have canceled the flight earlier so that at least the passengers could spend an afternoon outside of the airport. Air Asia is fine when everything goes well. But when there is a problem they will rip the passengers off. I flew from Kuala Lumpur to Sydney. The flight was cancelled after we had boarded. We had to queue for hours for various things. Air Asia did the bare minimum to help. I was informed via email that my flight had been changed from 4.20pm to 3.00pm which was fine but airport services were in fact terrible! Arriving at the counter at 1.15pm I asked the counter if there was a delay in our flight I was told that there was no such delay for our flight and that our boarding time was at 2.30pm. 2.30pm came and went and there was no announcement made regarding our flight. There was no one at the AirAsia departure lounge counter so I went to the check in counter and asked staff what our flight status was. I was then informed that there would be announcements. 3.00pm - no announcements. 3.49pm still no announcements. 4.17pm no announcement. 4.28pm an announcement that our flight will be delayed 1 hour. 5.35pm an announcement that the plane will not arrive until 6.05pm. 6.08pm arrival of the plane. 6.35pm boarding. 7.00pm on the flight I asked the flight attendant for my pre purchased comfort kit and was informed that they did not have any on the flight. As you can imagine after spending over 3hours waiting for the flight and being told that my comfort kit was not available I was mighty ticked. I know that there are circumstances that flight will be delayed and I understand that but the lack of communication given to customers was poor. I had heard such good things regarding AirAsia but after this and the cancelation of our Clark to Kalibo flight on the 14th of November 2013 I will be very hesitant and wary of using AirAsia again. Low cost flight low cost quality. Flew from Kuala Lumpur to Sydney. Then from Melbourne to Singapore in April 2014. The second flight was cancelled at the last minute so obliged to take midnight flight. Hours standing in a queue to check in luggage. Seats narrow and uncomfortable. No entertainment. Food and drink expensive with little choice. KUL-MNL-KUL. The airport where Air Asia international flights depart is supposed to be a domestic airport. My flight was at 4.20pm. I arrived at the airport around 1.30pm. Past 2pm they were not still letting us in. The waiting area and check in area is still serving the earlier flight to Korea. They just have 2 check in counters and 2 immigration counters of a supposed to be international terminal. I am from the Philippines and I feel for the foreigners who were with me on this terminal. I hope Air Asia can transfer all of their international flights to Terminal 3. Will take Air Asia to Manila once they transfer. Return flight from Bangkok to Udon Thanni. The four members of staff at boarding gate were either sleeping or playing with their phones. None took any interest in the customers despite the flight boarding time coming and going with no announcements. On the return flight 5 days later the cabin crew failed to notice 3 extremely drunk passengers who I guess were automatically allocated online emergency exit seats! When I told the cabin crew about this they asked them to move and one of the crew later thanks me. I sat in one of the emergency exit seats and was given no extra information which was unusual as every time prior when seated on such seats the staff took the trouble to make sure I was familiar with how to open the door in the very unlikely event of an emergency. I flew from Darwin to Bali on 21 April and from Bali to Darwin on 25 April. That was our first time trying Air Asia and we will not try again. On both days Air Asia was delayed for about 2 hour. There would have been no time to have the crew check the plane before it departed again. 7th May from Jakarta to Denpasar Bali. Flight QZ7532. Every single time I flew AA the flight was delayed. They usually use a random excuse like \"delay due to the late arrival of the aircraft\". This time 15 min before boarding I asked if the flight was on time. I was extremely surprised to hear that yes the flight was on time. 10 min before departure I enquired again as I couldn't see the airplane at the gate. Only then I was told that the flight was 2 hours delayed. As a pilot myself I know that staying on schedule is not always easy but being late by that much without having the ground staff to inform the passengers on PA I thought that was extremely bad. They can't care less about their passengers. Had the worst travelling experience travelling to and from Sydney to Phuket via KL. Hated every minute of it. Appalling service from the minute of check in both ends. Do not waste your time nor paper checking in beforehand. Do not buy food on board (maybe chips would be ok). Will never recommend nor use again. Yesterday I flew from Thailand to Malaysia. Air Asia charges extra for every possible option. I booked a \"hot seat\" which should have priority boarding. No priority was ever offered and I was stuck in a mad rush of people to get on the plane. I also pre-booked food. I saw the flight attendants bring food to several passengers around me but passed by me with the food cart. I had to call the flight attendant with the button and only after my boarding pass was inspected was my food served. The portion was inadequate to say the least. The bathroom was out of soap and when I again used the call button to get out of sight flight attendant's attention she explained that there had been many flight segments and that the soap had run out. No apology was offered although she did suggest I use the bathroom in the back. Trying to explain that the airplane should be serviced at every stop regardless of how many flight segments there are in a day was useless and she felt it was not her or the airline's fault that there was no soap. After about 45 minutes the entire flight crew went to the back of the plane and closed the curtain while they read the newspaper and chatted. No one was in the front of the aircraft until landing. The floor of the plane had bits of trash all about. The worst flight I have ever been on. Air Asia at first glance looks like a great deal but beware! As stated by others on this site they consistently block you from checking in online and pre-paying your bags. So on a domestic flight from Phuket to Bangkok instead of $330 baht per bag (about $10-11 US per bag) we had to pay a whopping $900 per bag (about $30 US per bag!) and it was their fault that we couldn't follow their procedure to check-in and pre-pay online. If you are sick (like I was) on the flight don't expect an air sickness bag in the pocket at your seat nor a blanket you have to buy the blanket. The flight was chaotic! There were toddlers running up and down the aisles screaming the entire flight with the flight attendants allowing it never mind the danger to the children! In-flight entertainment? None. Spend the extra and fly a real airline. The worst airline in the world in terms of customer service. I booked a series of flights 8 months in advance. Air Asia moved one of the flights causing a connection to be not possible. Air Asia then refused to allow me to move the flights to fix the connection conflict they caused and refused to give me a refund. I wonder what happens if I take the flights and get stranded when one flight lands after the connection has already taken off? Flew Phuket to Chiang Mai and got dinged nearly $60 CAD ($55 US) for a 20 kg bag. When I picked myself up off the floor I asked the desk person if I could avoid this sticker shock on my return flight. Told to go to the website check in online and 'pre-register' my bag online. The savings would be 'significant'. So today I did just that. Only problem - when it came to registering the bag the website froze me out - even after multiple attempts. Simply couldn't register the bag let alone pay a lower fee for it. When we got to the airport I explained the situation. We had checked in online so it was clear I wasn't pulling anyone's leg about trying to get things done on the website. But the check in person gave me the cow in a pasture stare and charged me full freight for the bag again. I explained again it wasn't my fault - I'd tried to do what her colleague had recommended - but their website wasn't working. I then told my story to the person who took my money. Same look. So watch out! Bag charges are exorbitant and going online to lessen the charge brings no joy. KL to Kota Kinabalu. I was hoping for a more Malaysian style welcome however I was not even shown to my seats. The cabin crew were fixing their hair and make up and chatting. I was not offended but in my 18 years of flying I have never seen such sight. Air Asia D7316 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing March 12-13. We have flown on airlines throughout the world and have never been on a worse airline in 50 years of flying. Kuala Lumpur airport is awful. When you ask if there are meals provided they say \"yes\" but don't tell you that you are required to pay extra. If you have cashed in your money because you are flying into another country you are out of luck. We were 6 hours without a coffee water or tea. When we asked for a complimentary coffee the flight attendant said \"No we are a low cost airline\". They nickel and dime you all the way. When you check in they ask if you would like to check your bag. Then hit you with a $30 charge! However they let all kinds of over-sized bags on the plane so getting to your seat is total chaos. Loading the plane is a joke. It is basically a stampede to the plane out on the tarmac it is a total free for all on the tarmac. Have flown with AA a few times this time RT from CNX to PEN. On the way from CNX to PEN I had to pay for the first checked baggage twice just because I had a transit in Kuala Lumpur. You will never know where they are going to put you in the airplane unless you pay to choose seat. While at Singapore Changi Airport it took me more than 2.5 hrs to queue just to check in. The AirAsia counters were grossly under staffed with 2 to 3 staff members frantically trying to process up to 4 or 5 flights of passengers. There was not enough staff to manage the queue many passengers were fed up and started queue jumping. Many passengers were late to board the plane not to mention time to shop the DFS stores. My flight to Bali took off an hour late. Worst experience I had with a budget airline. Kuala Lumpur to Manila. Pre flight customer service was a nightmare. My flight was delayed before my trip I was sent an SMS to be advised of this. I was offered an earlier flight that wasn't going to work because I was travelling from Adelaide at that time. There were no changes made and they acknowledged there was no change. When I arrived in KL to check in they inform me my flight was changed to the earlier flight. There was a lot of hassle and waiting but I was provided with my boarding pass. Flight was good aircraft could do with some updating but the flight was half empty which meant flat bed. Check in gave me a hot seat without paying for it. As soon as seat belt sign was off I went to sleep staff left me alone and it was all good. Cant comment on food or how the service was but as far as I am concerned in the air I got what I wanted. The selection of food is quite bland I would prefer to just take my food on board. For the price it was not bad. When it comes to Staff service I have based it on the pre customer service as that's where I experienced most of the customer service. Delayed more than 3 hours on flight to Bali from Kuala Lumpur on 9 Jan 2014. Although the ground staff knew about the delay in advance they failed to inform the passengers early - not only were we not informed at check in counter but only 1 hour prior scheduled take off time when we were at the gate. The airline changed the flight number causing great confusion and inconvenience for all passengers. No embarkation cards were also given out on board which is a normal procedure with all airlines. Air Asia maybe a budget airline but this does not give it a right to do what they want and as they please. Terrible experience. AirAsia failed to get me CGK-JKT on Christmas Eve. All they offered was flight to Sydney and Melbourne - and make your own way there. Couldn't offer me a direct flight for 48 hours from KUL although MAS had spare seats. I flew to Singapore from Sydney with Air Asia last week. I regret flying with AA. Pre-ordered meals were of very poor quality. There was a only very limited selection of food available for purchase - only peanuts chocolates and fizzy drinks. The flight was freezing cold and I had to pay money to rent a basic blanket. No credit cards are accepted on board. If you pay in dollars balance is paid in MYR- another rip off! There were 2 small children about 10 and 12 years travelling with their parents who changed their seats and moved near to a window just before we landed in KL to get a aerial view of KL. Many hot seats were unoccupied and were vacant throughout the flight and there was at most 20 min flight time left. The children were asked to return to their original seats by the flight attendant as they were not entitled to sit in \"hot\" seats. I thought the way they said was quite rude. The flight attendants speak little English. They are careless. I think what they sell as business class is probably as comfortable as Qantas Economy. It isn't low cost there are additions to the fares such as seat selection fee baggage fee meal fee and other hidden fees which all adds to and cost as near as a decent airlines like Thai Airways. Their services from ground to in-flight staff were inefficient. KOL-HKT 5 of us were travelling including my 2 year old daughter. Bangkok- Phuket being a short haul flight I skipped the seat selection (my biggest mistake). I told the lady at the check- in counter that we required 3 seats together minutes later our luggage was through and we were handed the boarding passes. All 5 of us were placed at different seats far from each other. Upon boarding I wasn't going to sit down until 3 of us were seated next to each other. A stewardess found 3 passengers who felt sorry for our situation and swapped seats. I saw their so called hot seats for which you pay extras for extra leg room were not any different from those ordinary seats. The seats were so cramped that you can hardly move if the seat in front was reclined back. Air Asia can change their flight timings anytime they want so stay tuned and updated. Our flight was postponed nearly 24 hrs.They claimed that they did try to contact me. At the sales desk we were told to wait an hour and see if there were any no shows. There were so we rushed to check-in luggage through and then told that there are only four seats left and we must hold the baby in our lap. We had no choice rushed to the aircraft as the last call was announced. We struggled just like before with the separated seats even though this time I had pre-selected seats with the original flight. We also had pre-booked meals with the original flight but since we boarded on a different flight they wouldn't serve us any meal. Air Asia in Bangkok lands at Don Muang Airport and not the Suvarnabhumi. The difference in two is that the Don Muang airport is an old airport and later is a new one. Everyone goes on a holiday to have a good time. Your holiday starts from the moment you are in the aircraft. Go for that little extra spending and choose a renowned airline. Flight from Guangzhou to Kuala Lumpur. All of their service is what the low cost airlines have. Normal seat without IFE without food serving. Recommend during great promotion and travel with only cabin baggage (quite expensive check-in baggage fee). I have traveled this airline twice. While their inflight service is average I found other aspects to be quite awful. I travel extensively across US Europe and Asia so have a good basis of comparison. If there is a problem - don't expect any competent problem solving. Ground staff are poorly trained and unhelpful in case of a problem. First time I traveled my flight from Phuket to Bangkok was delayed several hours and they had no idea when the flight was going to depart or even which gate it would depart from. On a recent flight from Siem Reap to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur several transit passengers had to be offloaded because they could not transit through KL - you need to enter the country and then exit via immigration so those from countries requiring visas were not able to board. They have no transit facilities at their hub in KL. The website clearly states they have through transit facilities - to this the passengers were told by the ground staff manager that the website is frequently incorrect and cannot be relied on. So that is the other problem - their website is unreliable and not kept current by their own admission. which in this day and age is totally unacceptable. Their terminal in KL is awful - it makes a Greyhound bus terminal seem sophisticated and comfortable. There is no place to sit and its bursting at the seams with passengers. If you have a long stopover be prepared to stand around or sit on the floor or on your bag. There is little to eat or drink until after you go past immigration to the gate but you can't check in to your flight until 2 hours before departure - so if you have a long break between flights you better come equipped. I have taken my last flight on AirAsia - it is truly the worst airline I have flown. The inflight service however is OK given its a totally discount airline with no frills whatsoever - you will pay for everything including water. SUB-KUL-HKT-CNX-KUL-SUB. SUB-KUL flight was pushed an hour early to 5.40am due to airport being overcrowded on Eidl Fitr holiday which was somewhat understandable. Having printed our boarding passes we still had to line up at the check in counter to pay airport tax. Once we arrived in KL we were ushered through the flight transfer area where staff informed us of our next departure gate and we had a pleasant 3 hour transit at the LCCT. Flights to and within Thailand were pleasant and punctual. Evening flight from Phuket to Chiang Mai they ran out of food by the time the crew got to our seats so we had instant noodles instead. In Chiang Mai we had to line up at the check in counter again to get a stamp in order to pass through the security check. We were rudely denied entry into the flight transfer area in KL on the way back to Surabaya because \"the flights were booked under different booking codes\". Note that there is no way to book AK and QZ flights under single purchase on the airline website and when we inquired the staff she mumbled something about \"not paying a transfer fee\" and us getting past the transfer hall last week was not meant to be part of procedure. We took our case to an immigration officer who accompanied us back to the transfer staff but turns out the immigration had to comply to airline policies. Begrudgingly we lined up at the long immigration lines to have our passports stamped entered the departure hall and lined up at the immigration again to find out that our flight was delayed 30 minutes. I am not going to fly Air Asia again unless I have no other choice. FD 2976/2977 Bangkok -–Denpasar return. A very disappointing experience. Checked in online and only had to drop our bag spent over an hour at the counter waiting for staff to reconcile their problem. Good that they are using Don Muang Airport otherwise the long immigration line would worsen the experience unorganized boarding and people in hot seats ended up among the last to board. Things get slightly better on the aircraft. Emergency exit “ hot seat” pretty comfortable with no other passengers next to me and I end up taking all 3 seats for myself. Pre- ordered breakfast (Pancake) is delicious great punctuality. Other than that things are pretty horrible and chaotic. Pre-ordered food on the return flight inedible rice stale meat overcooked and obviously is re-heated more than once. Drinks sold on board are lukewarm Flight attendants try to be overly friendly. Hot seat when the plane is full became unbearable for such long flight. Will avoid in the future. PER-KUL-DMK. Booked ticket 3 months earlier received reminder/confirmation email 4 days before departure 2 days before departure another email showing different times by 5 hours - no explanation just confirmation of flights but with different departure/arrival times. Arrival at DMK (Bangkok) would have had us there 1 hour after our connecting flight had left. No option but to go 1 day earlier and stay in hotel. Chaotic check-in at DMK under staffed 1 hour just waiting to check-in not good enough especially when it's a premium ticket they claim dedicated check-in for premium but no such counter exists. At the end of it all total cost was more than $100 more each than original quote on find flights result page. Cochin to Kuala Lumpur. Most uncomfortable flight I've been on. There is practically no leg space. Add to it the fact that I had a window seat with the other two seats filled in by slightly heavyset people and I felt like I didn't even have breathing space. It was so cramped that I didn't have space to move my hands. The choice of food on board is poor. Even when I asked for something that was on the menu they didn't have it. The only good thing was the rate but given the condition of the flight even the cheap rates do not sound tempting. My experience has been very negative flying with them. I flew with them last weekend from Phuket to Jakarta and the flight was 6 hours delayed. Absolutely no compensation provided. Our flight was changed from 7.30pm to 1.30am so we eventually arrived at 3.30am. No apologies or explanation given by the airline either. On top of this we paid for a \"hot seat\" which was uncomfortable and didn't recline. Never flying with them again. The food choices were also really bad. Many things were missing from the menu as they \"ran out\". In the last month my husband and I went on 4 Air Asia flights. It was a mixed experience. The inflight entertainment is very limited. Whilst some of the service was good and they were generally courteous there were inconsistencies across the board. We paid for an inflight entertainment package on our last flight but did not receive it. But on one of our flights we scored a deal where we were able to upgrade to premium which was much better and the service was more frequent but still very patchy. An experience which has really left a very poor taste in my mouth was having a check in lady be very rude and abrupt with my husband. KUL-SGN. Lovely looking stewardesses and new aircraft. Reasonably comfortable seats even for my 6ft 2\" 18 stone frame. But check in immigration departure lounge baggage reclaim? Just prepare to be treated third class and expect to be herded like cattle. They certainly bring a whole new level to \"no frills airlines\". Cheap and great for hopping around South East Asia truly the Greyhound in the skies. Melbourne - Chiang Mai return. Plane was a little late leaving Chiang Mai and due to \"congestion\" our plane landed at the international airport - presumably not carrying enough fuel to wait for a landing slot. Passengers not informed of what was happening and many missing connecting flights. Arrived at Air Asia terminal over 3 hours late. The Air Asia staff were if not rude then uncaring. About 20 people eventually marched through immigration and customs to a grotty corner of the airport - the desk for wheelchair service. Over 2 hours to rebook everyone using one computer terminal and entering computer codes manually. No food offered and no information given. Eventually ended up in a backpacker standard hotel - no towels in room no drinking water. To bed at 2am no food. Minimal breakfast in hotel but no lunch offered even though our substitute flight was 1.45pm. Low budget should not mean such rubbish service when the airline is at fault. Flew from Cochin to KL to Incheon. If you are taller than 180cm there will be not be enough room for your legs. They will push up against the seat in front and you will constantly get bumped if you're sitting in the aisle. Having to wait at LCCT is an awful experience. The public address system announcing the flights is ridiculously loud and the static is so bad that it's impossible to understand anything being announced. While boarding the crew insist on blasting cheesy rock music regardless of the time. The vegetarian food is over- priced for the small serving I received. The amount of money saved is minimal after adding up all of the extra costs. Flight AK1441 from Hanoi to Kuala Lumpur. Booking and flight document indicated departure of 21.00 Vietnam time and arrival 23.15pm Malaysia time with no delay in departure time. Arrived Kuala Lumpur at 01.15 (the next day) without any transit only to find out later that an added 2hrs flight is due to inconsistency in flight details generated by airline's system against actual flight duration. Ample of residual consequences including airport pickup charter and hotel booking arising with the timing mistake made by the airline's system. Flew from SYD-KUL return. Was quite happy with them on the first leg apart from the poor airport at LCCT on the return leg they changed the rules for cabin baggage denying both of us a second carrier bag allowed onboard. Very disappointing and rude ground staff. Very poor organisation. On the same flight staff failed to secure toilet doors before takeoff so they swung open abruptly. I'd avoid flying them again. We travelled from Tokyo Narita to Sapporo-Chitose on 22 Dec. Air Asia is the usual low-cost routine - a separate terminal with no facilities bus out to the plane at the far end of the airport tight seating and generally a joyless experience. Since when did air travel become so bland and so unexciting? Our biggest disappointment was the Air Asia terminal/departure lounge at Narita airport. Once you enter after check-in you cannot leave and there are no facilities except a toilet and a small shop. We felt trapped and stuck there in a facility that resembles a hospital waiting room. This in a busy and interesting airport with an array of shops cafes etc but we were stuck in this waiting room with no forewarning and no way to leave. Anyone checking in 3 hours in advance as requested would be well advised to time it to the last minute before going through security as this departure lounge is a horrid experience. I would also add looking at the ticket prices which creep ever upwards that the only thing cheap about low-cost travel nowadays is the way you feel after using it. Night flight from DMK-KUL last week and the flight was delayed 45 minutes. This week my friends took flight to SIN and CGK (both were from KUL) and both flights were delayed for 45 and 40 minutes. They had to pay midnight charges on their return trip from the airports not to mention the normal hassle when you got delayed. Having checked online for Yangon to Bangkok it just remained to have documents checked at the appropriate desk. 50 minutes later still waiting. They allowed passengers with checked luggage to use the same line and then a tour group had problems with documentation. Instead of asking them to stand aside to fill in the documents they let them block the line. The supervisor said \"you could have joined another line\" - yes at the back again! 3 hours delay on the flight Jakarta-Singapore. No information about what is going on delaying every half an hour. Horrible customer attention Service is awful. I was going from Chiang Mai to Bangkok and had a connecting flight from there to Copenhagen. I had nearly 6 hours to reach the connecting flight. Less than a week before going they cancelled the flight and rebooked me in a new one nearly 3 hours later. However this flight was delayed and I was too late to reach my flight. That meant I had to pay for rebooking and stay nearly 24 hours in the airport. I made a complaint to Air Asia but they would not pay because the delay was less than 2 hours. They could not see it as their problem that I was delayed more than 4 hours because of the rescheduling. I have flown Air Asia 8 times between CGK-SIN-CGK I have been on-time once. Regardless of price this is unacceptable. Each delay has been from 30 minutes to 3 hours and this is with good weather. I always pick a hot seat exit row. The pitch is fine but it's still tight. Crew's for the most part are friendly. They seem to be getting the Lion air attitude. \"Yea were late so what\". Anyway I'm heading back to Singapore Airlines. Yes it's more money but the delays are out of control at Air Asia. Flew from Bangkok (BKK) to Jakarta (CGK) on 27th June this year 2012. Paid for the trip by credit card now you have pay for the processing of the transaction. Every small thing is an extra now! The check in was fine but that was where it went downhill. Got to the gate 30 mins before boarding time and waited and waited the incoming aircraft had not even arrived yet. After another hour still no aircraft. What was totally unacceptable was the fact there was no announcement and no-one seemed to know what was happening I even suggested they call flight operations but they didn't. The flight eventually took off almost 2 hours late. Even though I had paid for a 'hot seat' the pitch is far from adequate and it wouldn't recline. Air Asia when they first started out were a good low cost airline and value for money but they have declined dramatically the prices have gone up and everything connected with the airline has gone down. I won't fly with them again! The joy that was AirAsia 10 years ago when I started flying with them is no more! On my last flight the problems were so bad I'm convinced this is no longer the way for me to fly even if its on a budget airline. I've already checked in and only needed to arrive early at the airport and then drop my luggage. Unfortunately for me the AirAsia check in system was down. This resulted in very long queues and after 40 long and uncomfortable minutes they resorted to manually check-in passengers and their luggage. While all that is happening they constantly announced about the failure and asked for patience but they continued calling passengers to board flights as if everything else is working. By the time I heard the boarding announcement for my flight we were still hopelessly stuck in the queue. When I approached a ground staff I was horrified to find out that the flight was to take off as scheduled! After at least 1 hour+ of delays thanks to their own check in system's outage I had to remind AirAsia's ground staff that we weren't late because of our own doing. Finally after some frantic phone calls and after realizing at least 50% of the flight passengers are still stuck in queues waiting to check in or to drop their luggage they agreed to delay the flight by 1 hour. Also if you have to board or disembark in KL's LCCT terminal when it's raining I think you will feel very differently about AirAsia - the experience is nothing short of horrible for passengers. Flight from SUB-BKK-HKT-BKK and KUL-SUB. The service was very bad and the crew very rude. I flew to Bangkok and then Phuket and always got a seat that couldn't recline because the button was broken seat pitch was also very bad. The Low cost carrier Terminal in Kuala Lumpur was very bad ground crew very rude to passengers. Don't use this airline you'll be very disappointed with its service crew and much more. We flew from SGN-BKK return in June 2012. I flew Air Asia ten years ago and found it was a fun inexpensive airline. How things have changed! It seems Air Asia is now all about squeezing as much money as possible out of the unsuspecting passenger. I can understand budget airlines charging more for the extra space of exit row seats but to charge you $11 extra because you have a medical condition that requires an aisle seat so you can walk during the flight or the same treatment to a passenger with motion-sickness being denied a window seat is a blatant rip-off. Your seat is selected randomly by a computer and if you don't like it then you pay $11 to change it. In Bangkok I tried to call Air Asia’s office 3 times but each call dropped out while I was waiting to speak to someone. The old 10kg baggage allowance has been reduced to 7 kg. (My carry-on wheeled backpack weighs 3kg) so that means I can pack not much more than my toiletries bag and a change of underwear before I exceed the weight limit. If you book on-line checked baggage fees and insurance are added unless you “uncheck” them. Boarding in BKK was a case of “first rush first aboard”. The flight itself was fine but the entire Air Asia experience leaves a lot to be desired. SUB-BKK then BKK-HKT-BKK and last KUL-SUB. The crew was impolite and unfriendly. When onboard from SUB to BKK and KUL to SUB I always found that my seat couldn't recline because the button had broken the seat pitch also unacceptable. When I was in the LCC terminal the ground crew were impolite and not responsive. This airline may be value for money but if you have heavy luggage this airline is not for you. AirAsia really disappointed me. Flew from KUL-BKI on 27 May 2012. Service is awful. No direction whatsoever from the ground staff. Queue system was a disaster as there's no indication of which line to go to. The monitor didn't help at all and I have a couple going to KCH queuing in front of me and a group going to Kuantan behind me. What a mess. The staff at the check-in was busy talking among themselves while my flight is 40 minutes from departure. Went into waiting hall and straight directed to plane. End up waiting 40 minutes on tarmac because 2 gates opened simultaneously and the 2 planes are located on the same aisle. My flight end up with 2 passengers to Johor and it took them 40 minutes to find that out. Paid for allocated seats to Phuket at the cost of $150 received confirmation of these seats on boarding they just shrugged their shoulders and said the seats are already occupied. Not good enough spoke to customer service on our return and can not refund this is most unacceptable they have taken $150 from us and we did not receive what we paid for other then this service was good. SYD-KUL then KUL-SYD. Paid for full premium seats plus meals. Before leaving Sydney I called Air Asia to purchase my inflight entertainment and was advised that due to my seat being a premium seat it came as a package. As expected was not the case when I got on the plane! Disappointing 8 hrs! For the flight back I was advised that there were no entertainment units left to pre-purchase and every plane was only allocated 10! I can see value in economy but not in premium/business class. We flew from Sydney to Bangkok and then from Phuket to Sydney. Staff were so rude and were unable to answer any questions. There was no inflight entertainment. If you wanted entertainment you had to pay extra for e-books. However there were none available on our flight. Even people who had pre-booked them couldn't get them because they were out. There were 3 of us travelling and we did not get seated together even though we checked in together. A family on our flight were also separated. Our flights were delayed also. I will never fly them again. Pay the extra money and go with another company. My family and I flew BKK-KUL KUL-SYD. Awful experience staff were rude no attention from flight attendants whatsoever. Seating space limited on both flights. Have been much more satisfied when flying on other low cost carriers. This is a bad bus service. On my travel BKK-CCU the check-in lines were ridiculous with attendants weighing every piece of baggage. Not sure if the web check-in works as I still had to stand in a long line for over 75 minutes to hand in baggage. The flight itself was fine seats seemed like they were for kids. Attendants seem inexperienced and lack manners. Our flight KUL-SGN was forced to return due to a tropical Storm in SGN. That was unavoidable so we accepted that we had no choice. However on return to the LCCT the absence of senior staff and the overall treatment of all passengers was appalling. Passengers were left to fend for themselves and there was a disgraceful lack of communication My wife and I had to make our own way through Immigration to try to find a hotel room. Staff seemed confused and leaderless. BKK-KUL KUL-HKT BKK-HKT. Had booked for my girlfriend and myself to fly from BKK-HKT but had to change plans and flew BKK-KUL and KUL-HKT later on. Fast check-in at Suvarnabhumi at self-check-in terminals but extremely slow baggage drop-off! Flights were acceptable considering the reasonably low prices. No attention from flight attendants whatsoever. Seating space limited on both flights. Have been much more satisfied when flying on other low cost carriers. Have been flying Air Asia for 5 years and now only when I have to. A discount airline but prices keep going up. Seats are narrow and all the advertising inside the cabin reminds me of a bus not an airline. BKK-Penang return. Asked and paid for assistance as have problems walking and needed a wheelchair. Had a chair on the outward trip as far as the bus then left to struggle on and off the bus on my own and to climb up to the aircraft. At Penang Airport had chair but had to walk up 2 flights of steps. The return was not too bad till got to Bangkok - no chair waiting the air hostess tried to ring for a chair but nobody answered the phone. Had to walk whole way through the airport with great difficulty and then collect my luggage. By the time I got to arrivals to meet my daughter I could hardly walk and was in a great deal of pain. Will never travel Air Asia again alone. Perth to KUL. My elderly mother paid extra to travel premium economy - what a waste! On both flights ground staff did not give priority boarding to premium economy passengers - everyone just barged on to the aircraft without a care for anyone else. Space between aisles was much tighter than other airlines and the seats certainly seem to be less roomier. Like a previous reviewer if you are going to have rules about luggage you must be prepared to enforce them! We had originally booked flights leaving Perth mid-afternoon and today I was informed by email that the flight had now been cancelled and we have been moved to an 8 pm flight. No sign of any compensation nothing but a note in the email to say that we hope it won't inconvenience you in any way! Flights from Perth-KL then KL to Bangkok return. 4 flights 1 was fantastic. The rest were very disappointing. Even a 3 star airline should be able to provide clean seating and toilets. We were subject to 'attitude' from staff when we complained about the chewing gum over our table dried vomit over the back of the seats in front of us and the accompanying smell. We were eventually moved. A toilet door broke because it wouldn't shut people sitting adjacent had to put up with the chemical smell. Our pre-ordered meals weren't served to us. Fully satisfied in the past however my last two trips were awful. Since Air Asia introduced web check-in the problem has started. My flight was to Chennai I did web check-in and arrived 2.5 hours early for baggage drop off. However the baggage drop off area was total chaos! People were cutting in between the lines without any respect for the queue. I waited in line for almost 2 hours without moving. 40 mins before departure two new counters opened for Chennai only and I managed to get my luggage dropped off 20 mins before departure. Ran for immigration but my expatriate gold card helped me pass through quickly and I boarded the flight 5 mins before departure. This has now happened to me a few times in the past when there was separate check-in counters there were no issue. Chandigarh (IXC) to Mumbai (BOM) 23rd Oct 2013. Not enough competent staff at the check in provided no customer service. Check in staff were treating them as competent staff and customers as idiots standing in front of them. No announcements regarding delay of more than one hour. Chennai-Pune (April 07 2013). Ground staff in Chennai non existent and no signs as to which was the GoAir counter and baggage screen. Had to check with other airlines. Flight delayed as pilot was late. The legroom in the plane was simply non existent. Taller people just be aware of it. They should have non reclining seats if they have non existent leg room. The plane was new and clean. Not bad as some American airline in terms of cleanliness. BOM-DEL DEL-Jimmu and DEL-GOI. Very pleasant airline. Good fares and upgrade to business and only INR1000 (15 euro). Food and drink served free and all middle seats empty. Nearly new A320s. Friendly crew. Delhi-Bombay booked a few hours before the flight and got a very low fare. At the airport took only 4 mins from baggage screening to getting my boarding card quick security check bussed to the plane. Airbus 320 with spacious seat. Food for purchase. GoAir only sells vegetarian food unlike Spicejet which also sells non-veg sandwiches. Food price reasonable and eatables fresh. Cabin crew response was swift. We were supposed to board our flight from Delhi to Lucknow at 12.15 on the 21st of May but there was confusion all around as the flight was late and the ground crew were not able to display any sign at the boarding gate or give us some explanation. Finally they herded us in a bus that was then parked in front of the plane on the tarmac for 20 minutes while the incoming passengers disembarked. Needless to say we were packed like sardines and it was extremely hot. Also there was no step - senior citizens like myself cannot climb easily. I have reported this before but it has made no difference. At Lucknow despite there being aerobridges we had to get down in the sun at 2:30 pm and were again herded into a bus. I was reluctant to board as the bus was very full but was forced to climb in. Is it a problem to use the bus a second time or the aerobridge or maybe nobody cares? It was the same story on the way back on the 22nd of May for the 6.40 flight. We were again stuffed into two buses and had to risk falling on somebody's luggage because the insensitive staff did not care. I will not travel on Indigo again unless they provide a step on the buses and do not herd us in like cattle. Was travelling from Dubai to Mumbai. I was fond of Indigo before this trip. Check-in was smooth and my hand baggage was less than 7 kgs so there was no excess luggage charge. However got some shopping from the Duty free. As far as I know and being travelled on other airlines for international trip. Shopping at Duty free is not considered as Hand baggage weight. Wait this is Indigo. You would find some one waiting at the boarding counter with weight machine. And charged me for the extra weight just for the shopping at Duty free. What more the person carries only manual slip. No credit cards accepted not even USD or INR (Globally accepted currency / Home currency). Had to go back to the currency counter to exchange. This was horrible experience had to shell out additional 1500 bucks (40 AED / Kg). Plus went inside and saw some seats at emergency exit were empty. Asked the cabin crew if I can sit at emergency exit as have some extra leg space answer I got was that I would have to pay extra if I want to sit. They would rather keep the seat vacant then let some one sit. Very disappointed with the approach. Delhi (DEL) - Kolkata (CCU) 6 Nov 14 6E219 - Was traveling with a small trolley bag (15\" diagonally) and a compact laptop bag (15\" diagonally). Total weight 11 kgs. Got the shock of my life when they said that they wouldn't allow more than 7 Kgs in cabin including laptop. Now I had a laptop and charger. Then I had a SLR Camera with lenses plus a change of clothes and some files. They asked me to pack all the fragile items into one bag and check-in the other. Imagine my situation. There was no way I could fit all the fragile items into one bag and weigh in at less than 7 kgs. I checked-in the bag and nothing was damaged. On to other aspects of the flight. The seats are cramped and the seat back is very thin. You feel the knees of the guy behind you! The food they sell is mediocre. If you want on time performance then probably this LCC is the best in India. But if you want customer friendly service comfortable seats good food or in-flight entertainment (none exists on Indigo aircraft's) or for that matter a reasonable cabin baggage policy then do look elsewhere. Flight 6E 473 from Mumbai to Bangalore was delayed by 12 minutes at 22.02 HRS due to weather conditions en-route to Bangalore. However it took the airline 42 minutes to deliver baggage - first bag was delivered at 22.42 hrs! Bangalore Airport is very efficient and I have not experienced baggage delays in the past 3 years - both domestic and international flights. This delay was primarily due to inefficiency and bad co-ordination amongst the ground staff. Today IndiGo Airlines ground staff were pathetic and inactive - they repeated baggage will be on belt in 2 minutes while it actually took over 40 minutes. No supervisory staff were available to address the issue. Rain had stopped when this flight landed. Since this flight had no aerobridge facility we had to disembark from the flight - walk down an uncovered ramp into the bus. None of us were wet - but airline ground staff observed heavy rain to delay baggage delivery by 40 minute! Indigo Flight 6E 412 from Kochi to Bangalore landed at 22.06 hrs even this flight was late. But the last bag for this Indigo flight was on belt at 22.24 hrs. If the same airline can deliver bags for a flight that landed 4 minutes after the Mumbai-Bangalore flight how can they blame the weather system! I don't see any reason other than staff inefficiency and bad co-ordination for this delay. I recently travelled on an Indigo flight from Delhi to Mumbai. My printed ticket stated that I was allowed to carry one checked in bag of 15 Kgs one cabin bag of 7 Kgs and in addition a laptop bag. However during check in I was asked to weigh all three pieces (suitcase cabin bag and laptop) and was told that the cabin baggage allowance was only a total of 7 Kgs which includes laptop bag shopping bags and cabin bag. So please note that if you decide to travel with Indigo airlines you are only allowed one suitcase of 15Kgs and all your cabin bags (laptop shopping bags and cabin bag) should not exceed 7 Kgs. Moreover what is printed on the ticket makes no difference to them. Flight 6E 284 from Chennai to Delhi on 6th Feb 2014. I took the morning flight at 8.20 am this meant that I did not have my breakfast before the flight. The flight duration to Delhi is 150 minutes. I wanted to have my breakfast on the flight I was waiting with my purse in my hand. The air hostesses were slow and inefficient to say the least. They just walked past me and did not ask if wanted anything. They simply pushed the trolley past and went and sat down. I gave up and sat extremely hungry and frustrated. I flew from Pune to Bangalore on 30th December 2013 on Flt 6E 407. I bought a chicken sandwich for my son and it was awful! I usually fly Indigo Airline because of it's assurance of timely arrivals and departures. I've never had a reason to complain until my last experience. The flight was delayed. But the worst part was that the on board staff was inattentive and didn't even attempt to sell any meals on board. They just served passengers who had pre-booked their meals. When I asked for the chicken sandwich the flight attendant stared at me like I'd asked her to bring me an elephant from the zoo. This is the first time I've been on the receiving end of aloof treatment from Indigo staff. Dehli-Kathmandu-Dehli. Unfriendly staff they ask you to be at the airport 4 hours before departure for international flights and 2 hours for domestic flights. Arrived 3.5 hours early as anticipated no check-in counter was open. Nevertheless the plane seemed to be quite new and comfortable. BOM-LKO. Flew on Indigo thrice and all 3 flights were delayed. Paid extra to book seat of choice and meal. Check-in staff extremely rude and unfriendly. Cabin was not as clean as they rave about. Inflight cabin service without a smile. Only cold meals served. They also charge for wheelchairs with fares comparable to full service carriers. Not my choice and not recommended. Very pricey for a 'low cost airline'. Airline staff at Ahmedabad were unprofessional and non-committal. Flight to Bangalore from Ahmedabad scheduled at 5 pm was delayed more than 3 hours and the behaviour of ground staff was irresponsible. As the expected time neared and no trace of the aircraft was seen the answer I got from ground staff was \"we don't know\". Arrival at Bangalore airport was chaotic. It took ground staff more than 40 minutes to put the baggage on the carrousel. Passengers arriving on other airlines were exiting the terminal before our baggage was even on the carrousel. Indigo was my preferred airline until my previous trip - a very steep deterioration in quality. LHR-BOM BOM-MAA. The meal was poor. The quality of entertainment was not satisfactory. There was transit from Domestic airport to International in Mumbai. No proper direction from the ground staff and felt they were not concerned at all, in spite of the flight from London Heathrow with numerous transit passengers. The staff attitude was very poor. Both on my onward and return journey, the snack was bad and no tea was provided citing climate reasons. But, crew would selectively serve Hot coffee to some. Seat were normal and comfortable. The service was delayed by close to 1 hour and return flight was on-time. This is a low quality service airline. I have been a loyal Jet Airways member for the past 8 years. Year after year I have seen their services slip. Inedible food, poor cabin crew, dirty aircraft and the list goes on. This particular journey was the worst till date. The seat and the leg area was not cleaned. When I called the cabin crew, she said she would clean it, however the aircraft was getting ready for departure and the crew asked me to have a seat in the filthy area.  Delhi to Singapore return is a narrow body aircraft which is typically used in domestic sector in india. The space between two seats is so less that headrest of the front row seat hit me when reclined. Some of the seats don't straighten up properly. The entertainment system does not function properly (had to do without it on my return flight). The inflight food service is poor, staff missed passengers in their service and the passenger in front of me had to call the steward to get his meal. They seem to be short of staff. I flew this route to Delhi approximately two years ago and the service then was much better than what it has become now. Firstly this is a 4 hour flight and they do not have any inflight entertainment. Two years ago they had seat back to screens with quote a few movies. The food was also below average.  The aircraft from Bangkok to Delhi was absolutely filthy. Some sticky liquid had probably been spilt all over the tray table. Jet Airways has dropped in its standard of service over time. I have flown many flights on low cost budget airlines in India which offer much better service than Jet. Would not travel again. Travelled from Delhi to Mumbai, 9W 354 departing Delhi at 7.45 pm. Flight delayed due to technical fault announced. However all passengers made to sit in aircraft by 8.15 pm. There was no AC working, captain informed that cooling would be better once airborne. After take off no effect. Captain says he would inform a technician to rectify it after landing in Mumbai. They knew in Delhi that the AC was not working, they allowed the flight to take off.  We have recently flown Business Class to Dubai as well as Bangkok from Mumbai and decided never to travel Jet to an Asian destination again. While their longer-haul aircraft and cabins are good their short-haul flights are an apology for Business fare travel with dated seats no leg rest no personal entertainment systems. Bangkok as well as Dubai airports having terrible depressing business lounges for any airlines besides their own national carriers. Have rated value for money as Fair below just cause we pre-booked these tickets at discounted rates. Mumbai to Singapore and back from Singapore to Mumbai 24th April-12th May. The seats were terrible so much less legroom - we were almost cramped. On the return flight there were a few arguments amongst passengers when they were trying to recline their seats. My experience was so bad that I will never travel on Jet and never recommend. I recently flew Kochi - Dubai - Kochi. I had a very interesting experience on the return leg. During lunch service I asked for a Beer. I was served a warm flat can of beer that was lousy. I waited patiently until the stewardess came around for the 2nd round and requested a vodka. The reply given to me was \"No. I cant serve you a Vodka because you had earlier asked for a Beer\". I told them that the beer was warm and flat to which the solution offered was \"I will serve it with Ice\". When asked why this stupid rule the answer was \"This is company policy Sir\". I refused their beer. Thank you Jet Airways for the lousy flights you operate with no entertainment cramped seats et al this is really the icing on the cake. Lousy attitude. Flew Business Class Bangkok-Mumbai-Paris CDG R/T. The flight from BKK to BOM was very average on an old 737. Eight business class seats that barely reclined no foot rest no in-seat entertainment system just one very small video screen on each side of the aisle that dropped down from the ceiling and showed one movie. Food OK service good and friendly. Would not recommend Jet Airways for this segment in business class for a 5 hour flight - no value for price. BOM to CDG was on a modern A330 with herringbone flat bed business class seats great 100 channel personal entertainment system with a very large video screen massage function in the seat very private configuration power and USB outlets nice duvet for sleeping food and service very good. However our flight was 2 1/2 hours late taking off due to air traffic congestion in Mumbai. Because of this we missed a connecting flight in Paris and had to stay overnight. It took the ground staff 2 hours to sort out our new flight the next morning iand arrange for our airport hotel in Paris (Sofitel - they paid) but we were not able to retrieve our luggage so no fresh cloths the next day. Our return flights had ticketing/computer problems which caused delays with our check-in and none of the special meals we ordered through their website were ever delivered for any of our flights. Jet Airways is really hit or miss and I would not fly them again unless no other choice available. London-Amritsar (18 March) return flight Delhi-London (14 April). If you are worried that transfer time at Delhi Airport which is about two hours may not be sufficient to go through immigration collect your baggage and then catch the onward Amritsar flight don't. You only need to collect your baggage. You don't have to re-check in for Amritsar flight at Delhi. Your baggage is checked in for Amritsar at London airport and you are given the Amritsar as well as Delhi boarding passes. At Delhi airport you collect your baggage go through the Green channel and head for Domestic transfer which is barely five minutes walk. At the domestic transfer your passport and boarding pass are checked. On entering domestic transfer you place your baggage on the conveyor belt and head for domestic security. The entire process - immigration collecting your baggage and catching Amritsar flight - takes no more than forty to forty five minutes. Moreover Jet Airways ground staffs at the baggage collection belt are there to guide you to the domestic transfer. However I have two complaints against Jet Airways. The first is that their in-flight service is simply appalling. The in-flight crew do bare minimum. They simply disappear after serving the meal. If you need anything you will have to run after them. There is however a good variety on the meal but not on the drink menu. You are unlikely to get a service with a smile on the Jet Airways - its in-flight crew in my views are not properly trained. My second complaint is its bad time-keeping. My Delhi-London flight was 1 hour 30 minutes late not because of any technical reason but because Jet Airways could not leave without picking up passengers from its Kathmandu-Delhi flight. If you are thinking of booking London-Amritsar flight your best option in my views is still Air India not Jet Airways. Recently travelled to and from Hawaii out of Vancouver. These routes use Westjet's newest version of the B737 yet they are the most uncomfortable seat that I have ever sat in. Absolutely bare minimum support ultra thin and have no built-in entertainment system. Obviously the need to cram that extra row of seats into the aircraft is more important than customer comfort. On our return from Kona to Vancouver the plane seemed to have a very quick turnaround and after only 90 minutes into the flight all 3 toilets became inoperable and were overflowing. It was obvious that no servicing had taken place following the flight out and a full flight was forced to endure a further 4 ½ hours without using the onboard facilities. This we felt was disgusting and irresponsible. My second time travelling Jet and I must say I am utterly displeased. The first time I went from Mumbai to Abu Dhabi to catch a connecting flight there and I must say that it wasn't anything to remember. The seats were okay and the food was fine. It is very low class in front of its partner Etihad. But the second time around I was very disappointed. We were travelling from Mumbai to Bangkok and the first thing that we noticed on the plane was that there was no entertainment system! I was shocked and the final blow came when my mother asked for a blanket which are usually placed on our seats in all international flights and do not have to be asked for the attendant said that they had run out of blankets. I think Jet overbooked the plane and did not have enough resources. The seats were good and the food wasn't bad but the above couldn't be compensated. We booked our flight with Wizz Air because it was the most affordable option to get from point A to point B. That said we definitely got what we paid for – long waits (for seemingly no reason) out-of-control lines with no rules being enforced for the “first come first served” boarding process and the airline staff themselves (maybe contracted – couldn't tell) even allowed people from the back of the line to jump ahead of others who had been waiting for 30+ minutes to board. Due to this my husband and I were unable to sit next to each other during the flight – and we were finishing up our honeymoon destinations. If you're looking for no frills long lines and no rule enforcement Wizz Air is the way to go. WS3415 March 19 to Thunder Bay. We arrived home at 4 am today. Our flight was late as they said they waited for a group of 19. Do you realize how many were on plane who had made arrangements for pick up. Then we get to park and fly and machine wouldn't take ticket. Phoned for help and gentleman couldn't get it after 6 tries. In Thunder Bay granddaughter asked for earlier flight as grandson was sick. Attendant agreed but had to get it signed and this one couldn't subtract 2 from 3 as one was having to stay back. Granddaughter in Thunder Bay is disappointed as she says we wont come back. Jet Airways are simply not in the big league. Without a change of culture training and people they never will be. Flew Singapore Delhi and return in economy. Staff can be good if they feel like it but after take off from Changi they lost all interest. Delhi to Singapore was forgettable. Food is poor service is basic seat comfort poor entertainment very average. Overall avoid unless necessary. Unfortunately the only options for Canadians wishing to go to Hawaii are to stop in a US city and suffer through poor connections and lengthy trips or to use Air Canada and Westjet. For an 8 hour flight using even the premium seats are uncomfortable. The entertainment is non-existent unless you buy a tablet for 17$-which works well if you buy it. For a family of five you are nickle and dimed to death-think 250$ each way for luggage add 100$ for food. Staff are at best evasive and at worst frankly ignore you. Two water offers for a 7 hour flight is lame. The state of Canadian air travel is pathetic and WestJet is the poster boy for extra costs and lacklustre service. Flight was delayed flying from Toronto to Vegas. Inflight entertainment screen was broken. Flight 1116 seat 14b. Our return was delayed for 2 hours due to maintenance. We were flying with our 1 yr old and we timed our kid to sleep on most part of our journey. We ended up being stuck in the airport for 4 hours and didn't arrive back in Toronto until 11.30pm. These delays screwed up our plan and created inconvenience for us. I would strongly not recommend this airline. Horrendous return journey from Delhi - over 3 hours on tarmac waiting for an engine fault to be repaired after a flight delay of over an hour. The cabin has the narrowest aisles possible and maximum number of seats. Difficult to move legs or stand up - Capitalism gone mad. All of this after an early morning flight from Nepal resulting in over 24 hours journeying. Never again. My Jet Airways 9W11 flight from Singapore to Mumbai on 1 Mar 2015 was a regrettable experience. It appeared that they used an aircraft traditionally used on shorter domestic routes on this sector. So leg space (space between rows) on the 5 hour flight was extremely cramped. What really made the flight unacceptable was that they turned off the aircon midway during the flight. It was only after the cabin became unbearable warm passengers were roused from their sleep and a passenger complained the aircon was switched on back - but barely so. The cabin remained uncomfortable. As others note cabin crew were curt - bordering on rude. Jet is now my least preferred airline. Westjet may be fine for a very short flight. But to Hawaii forget it. Always late. Terrible service. Very uncomfortable. The staff are grumpy and spend most of their time in the galley eating and gossiping. Very disappointing. I have never met a group of cabin crew so unwilling to help passengers. I though I was unlucky on my flight from London to Mumbai but the crew on the return trip were possibly worse. Clearly passengers are an inconvenience that should just go to sleep and not bother the crew. I was refused a coffee as we were an hour from landing (even though they still hadn't finished clearing from breakfast so it should have been a simple ask). Another major annoyance were the tannoy announcements all through the night telling us we were entering turbulence so should fasten our seatbelts. Most humane airlines mention at the start of a night flight that passengers should keep their belt visible so that they don't have to wake us. There were only 15 movies on offer of which only 2 or 3 are new releases. I won't go into details on the food I handed it back and got extra bread instead (though the guy was reluctant to even provide this). Hopefully never again. Unfortunately Jet Airways appears to have caught the Air India disease and is now offering quite a 'below par' service. The cabin crew are not attentive and a smile is seen as a bonus the whole thing seems to be a cattle truck these days. Our flight was delayed (these things happen) but there is little in the way of welcome when boarding and the crew clearly don't want to be there just simply going their motions. The headphones were broken both outbound and inbound tea and coffee unavailable inbound soft drinks well what can I say self service with a disinterested crew. Inflight was very disappointing to say the least some of the lowest quality I have come across in my travels. Drinks were simply rushed through and on 2 occasions had the cup and/or tray taken from my wife even though she was still eating! Not once but 2 times the reason was simple they wanted to rush through and get the job done for their benefit and not the customer. Overall the crew were unprofessional and left numerous blinds down during landing and were even walking around the cabin with the seat belt signs on! I doubt that conforms with their operations practices. This was a good airline but now seems to behave as if they're doing the customer a big favour. December 29 2014 three adult members of my family flew Economy from Toronto to Bangalore with stops in Brussels and Delhi and then onto Kochi. We flew back on January 9 2015 the same route. Flying 15.5 hours from Toronto to Delhi and back was a torture primarily due to: 1) Worn out seats with hardly any cushion 2) no hot water in toilets 3) filthy floor in toilets 4) toilet tissue running out on two flights with no one paying attention 5) poor quality of food and worst of all 6) waiting nearly two hours in Toronto upon our return for the luggage to arrive. More than half of the flight staff was courteous. We took altogether 8 flights with Jet Airways internationally and within India and none departed on time. At least on two International flights the seats were so stuck trying to get them to recline was a challenge. Although the entertainment selection was pretty good the headphones given out had gone through hardly any quality control; one of them was dead and another with its cable coming off. During the stop over in Brussels both time the passengers got out stood in long queue simply to go through a security check by extremely rude airport staff with no time to freshen up read: washing our face with warm water! It seemed no one controlled the temperature in the planes during flight at times it got too cold and then too warm. Over all we decided unanimously never to fly Jet Airways again. I want to commend Jet Airways for their service on a recent flight. A group of 5 of us were travelling from Delhi Flights between Heathrow / Deli - Mumbai / Heathrow. Whole 10 hour flight one very small bottle of water offered with a meal. Food Issue - staff passed by without offering drinks. Had to ask for tea / coffee with the meal that was offered. Poor quality service all round. Brussels to New Delhi on 31.12.2014. The crew not good. Whenever I tried to call the crew for help they just turned off the signal and never came. As I travelled with two children I needed it wasn't possible to always go to the galley. Many passengers were facing the same problem. I had a good experience with them during my domestic flights. This is first time I travelled with them outside of India and wouldn't consider it again. I flew YYZ-YVR on 22 December 2014. Slight delay departing Toronto as cabin crew did not show up on time. As this was one of WestJet's newer Boeing 737-800 there were no personal TV screens on the back of the seats. Instead WestJet rented Samsung Galaxy tablets for $5 + tax to anyone seeking inflight entertainment. The Tablets and the headphones that came with it were horrible - I was unable to hear what was happening in the movie. In order to properly view the movie one had to hold the tablet in front of one's eyes for 3 hours - my hands became quite tired after a while. The selections of available movies and TV shows were extremely limited and dismal. No hot meals available for purchase - only a choice of ham/cheese croissant or turkey sandwich for $7 + tax each. Flight crew took over 2 hours to serve beverages and sell sandwiches. Flying WestJet was an atrocious nightmare for me - I get the same level of service I would flying Ryanair Easyjet or another budget airline but I pay 3-4 times what the budget airlines charge. Utterly shameful! We travel WestJet often from Vancouver to Toronto and then Barbados. Lately we have a major complaint with booking our flights. There is no indication whether the flight is direct or has stops. If the price is reduced because there is a stopover fine but let us know. It will then be our choice to decide if the reduced price is more important than our time. An extra hour added to an already long trip may not seem like much but to very tired customers who were not informed before booking the tickets it is very annoying. We like WestJet and it is convenient in Terminal 3 in Toronto for the overnight stop at the hotel but we seriously looking at the competition for our next trip. We make this trip a minimum of three times a year. Flew from YVR to Maui. I've always made the choice to travel with Westjet when fares have been comparable with AC. In this case it was the wrong choice. The inflight entertainment for a 6 hour flight was a limited selection of movies on a tablet you need to pay extra for. For kids there was really only one film they would be interested in and even that my kids got bored of. I'm sure there are executives at Westjet patting themselves on the back for the resounding success of the tablet service but really it's just a sign of desperation from their once loyal customers to find anything to do on a 6 hour flight. The other option they give you is a seat back pocket filled with rag magazines. We also made the effort to take 2 checked bags for a family of 4 but now with their check bag fee they're incentivizing us to each carry as much as we can a carry on. The only positive part of our flight was that they were on time both ways. With the line of service between AC and WJ being more blurred the folks running WJ are sadly sending their customers to seek other travel alternatives. Flying from Cancun to Saskatoon the afternoon of December 2 2014 service was very poor delayed by almost 2 hours with no explanation try to buy food none available same with drinks. Flight number was WS 2421. YYZ-YWG-YYZ WestJet is known for its easy going/joking atmosphere. But these things do not replace punctuality and reliability. Flight to YWG packed tense making the crew's jocularity annoying. The desk clerk told us that she was \"saving us money\" by charging us 56 dollars to check our bag. YWG back to YYZ was late to depart and late to arrive We waited some considerable time to dock at YYZ as West Jet had no staff to do it. The cabin was stiflingly hot and a passenger was using his cell phone while in the air. Of course we were quite late in getting luggage and our bags looked ten years older when they finally arrived. Fewer jokes and better service is what we wanted. Flew Vancouver to Honolulu recently on a B737-800 without TV's! Seats were uncomfortable and the lack of TV's on a 6 hour flight is surprising. Westjet now will rent you a tablet if enough are available which I suppose is the next trend for the airlines to get more money out of the customers. Westjet seem to have lost their way and have become like the competition something they vowed would never happen. Time to return to the service-oriented company you were. Would be nice if they enforced the carry on rules. I recently flew to Las Vegas from Calgary and back by Westjet. Flights were very late in both directions. There was no TVs on either flight. I pre-ordered food for the flight for myself and the person I was travelling with. When the flight attendants came they wanted to know if I wanted to buy anything. I told them I already did and had a copy of the receipt on my phone. The flight attendants were then running around looking for the food. The food was not on the flight. Two attendants told us to pick something else in exchange for when I bought. We picked and the attendant then tried to get me to pay for it again. On their website for pre-ordering food you can contact them by e-mail if there was a problem. I did that oer a week and a half ago and no one replied. I usually fly Air Canada but Westjet advertised a better flight time. Since we were so late the Air Canada flight would have been about the same time and I would not have had to sit in the airport for late flights in both directions. Singapore-Delhi 9W017. Not sure where to start our most horrible experience up in the air. This wasn't due to any one-off disappointing event that biased the review but an overall awful treatment one is subjected to once they are locked in the cage for 6 hours. Seats: I am not sure if this airline is even complying with the DGCA regulations for how much space needs to be provided to the passengers. Almost everywhere you could hear passengers complaining of congestion. On top of that seats aren't comfortable. Our international flight was followed by a domestic one (on a different airline) which had much more room than an international flight by Jet airways. Food and Beverages: Food was tasteless. Indian food served on my previous leg (with Qantas) was far better than an Indian airlines serving the same cuisine. My wife didn't even eat it. As for the wine only suggestion I have for you is not to order it. The staff do not understand wines much but that can be overlooked given this was least of a concern on that flight. Ambience: Temperature setting did add to the discomfort it was too warm for me to feel comfortable in the pigeon-hole. This wasn't a 1 hr. short hop flight but a long 6 hr. which can even be hard to bear for a whiskey drunk passenger (pun intended). Advice to Qantas would be to reconsider their code share partnership as one doesn't pay a premium (to Qantas) to fly this bird cage. Connection to India will be a tough call given Air India isn't great either but at least they have new planes. Kuwait to Mumbai on 28 September 2014. Only 2 toilets available for all economy passengers toilets soon dirty not cleaned. Uncomfortable seats. As soon as plane landed in Mumbai and still moving fast seat belts were opened and passengers started pulling bags out of the overhead lockers. Staff's reaction was late and not effective. Then pulling shoving and pushing to get out of airplane first window seat passengers elbowing their way past aisle seat passengers chaos reigned. Never again Jet Airways! We flew on one of the first flights offered by WestJet to Dublin. The flight from Halifax to St.John's was not bad but was very basic with hard seats and no legroom. We thought that we would certainly upgrade to a larger plane for the cross Atlantic flight but we shocked when we got back on to the same plane. The fact that we had to re-book our seats for the second leg of the flight certainly led to the impression that we would not be getting back into the dinky seats that we had just left. It was the most miserable overseas flight I have ever had and there was no way either of us could get comfortable. Our video screens did not work and the staff only shrugged. On the return flight we upgraded to the Plus seats at a cost of 65 Euros each ticket. More legroom softer (but still narrow) seats and free but dry sandwiches. Free drinks not worth it since all we wanted was tea and juice. The video screens worked but I had purchased my own earbuds earlier in order to avoid the overpriced ones offered on the plane. A slight improvement but not what you would want in an overseas flight. At least we weren't in pain when we landed unlike the outbound journey. This was our first venture with WestJet. If I have anything to do with it it will be our last. I shall gladly pay a higher price for more comfortable flight. When will airlines realize that the flight itself is a major part of a holiday experience? Flew into Canada and then returned to the US on Westjet. Both flights were delayed which caused us to miss our shuttle connection on arrival and had to wait three hours at the airport for the next one. I was expecting a standard international type flight and was astounded to find that in seat entertainment had to be paid for and that we were given a teensy packet of sesame sticks and drink only. Considering the high cost of the flights something more should have been standard. Each passenger is forced to watch never ending advertisements on the seat screen if you do not pay for entertainment. Given the delay it would have been good for customer relations to allow free entertainment. I will not choose or recommend Westjet to anyone. We went on a one-week vacation to beautiful Samana. Upon arrival to the Ottawa Airport we couldn't check in using my husbands passport due to WestJet making a mistake on his name. A very nice representative helped us at Ottawa airport to check in using my passport. On the flight from Toronto to Samana I ended up in the middle seat besides a drunken passenger who just shut the window blind down and spent the entire trip sleeping and invading my personal space. Those planes are small so having to fight off your little space with another passenger is draining. My husband sitting on the alley chair had half his elbow bumped several times by one of the flight attendants. The plane was smelly but at least it wasn't visibly dirty this time. In-flight food: Their free offerings were the poorest I've had the displeasure of experiencing: tiny glasses of water/soft drink/coffee and just two 14 grams bags of cookies or sesame sticks for a 4 hours flight. I understand this was supposed to be a value flight but it wasn't the least expensive in the bunch when compared with Air Canada offerings. All the above mentioned would have been forgiven and forgotten had it not been for the nightmarish experience we had on our flight back. As stated we were among the first to arrive at Samana airport once there we were given two seats together (window and middle): all nice until we got on the flight. The seats were not reclining and we had not been informed. Once the people in front of us reclined we realized that it was impossible for us to do the same. My husband called the flight attendant thinking there was a way of reclining but she just said it was not possible in a rushed manner as if we were a nuisance. For four hours we had to sit uncomfortably with our knees being constantly banged by the hyper kids sitting in front of us and without any possibility of rest. I do believe that if the airline is going to take away a passengers right to a reclining chair/cabin space they should at least offer some kind of compensation be it in the way of a pillow for their sore-necks or a food voucher. To make things worse the cabin on the flight back to Toronto was extremely dirty. The smell could be catalogued more as a stench. The cherry on top was that our connection to Ottawa was delayed for 30 minutes or more due to WestJet having a flight from Cancun being delayed also so we ended up missing our bus connection at the airport. (YVR-YYC: Vancouver to Calgary Boeing 737-700/800) I fly this route for business at least once a month and for me WestJet has slowly started to go down hill within the last 8 months. I have found the customer service WestJet had in the beginning is not there anymore. I usually take the 10am morning flight out of Vancouver and have had no issues in the past. My last flight with them was on September 3rd to the 5th and I was very disappointed. The flight was delayed for more then 2 hours (it happens when you fly a lot no big deal) but my problem was that they didn't keep anyone notified on the status of the flight. On the way back it was even worse. My flight back to Vancouver was supposed to depart around 7:50 but we got delayed for a half hour which turned into 3 hours because of \"mechanical\" issues. Once again no WestJet staff were there to answer any questions or give us any info on the flights status. We didn't end up departing until ten to midnight. Too many times this has happened the last few months. I can't believe I'm saying this but I think I am going to start using Air Canada and fly on the less cramped Embraer 175. My sister took the 10.10pm WJ412 flight on Aug 26 from YVR and her flight was delayed 35 mins. Next day my other sister and I took WJ412 at 10.10pm from YVR and again the flight was delayed half an hour. All three of us returned from YEG on Aug 31 on the 4.05pm WJ109 flight - delayed (again) - over 45 mins! We will never fly Westjet again. Part of the delay on Aug 31 was that someone was sitting in our seats - same seat# on Boarding Pass - turns out they had been on the previous flight and no-one bothered to check that they had the next (5pm) connecting flight to YVR and should have got off the plane! They didn't speak much English so it took 15 mins just to get them (4 people) off. Every week from Victoria to Calgary sick of full flights when they leave late there is no explanation its always a mad rush to get on because they never adhere to rules of boarding by row's. They also never adhere to baggage size anyone can take any size bag and just take up all the room by putting it sideways in the overhead. Fed up seeing the long faces of the staff with the occasional false smile not all their fault because the company is always trying to squeeze every cent of profit. Have travelled with Air Canada on same route they are even worse. Look forward to the day when another company enters the route. The small seats and no leg room are another annoyance looking forward to when the other competition gets in on this route all it takes is another company who are not trying to squeeze quite as much profit not a big ask. Flight 121 on August 16th. London to Delhi then a domestic flight. Wasn't pleased at all. Entertainment selection was very poor but that didn't concern me much. Seats were okay. Toilets were not as clean and not at all fresh from the very beginning of the flight. Attitude of the crew were as if they wished they didn't have to serve the passengers. Not even once any of them said \"welcome\" or smiled to my \"thank you\" which I said out of habit every time any of them served me. Food was tasteless. Coffee was served cold both times. Trays was cleared much later after passengers were done eating. Some had to get out of their seat to go to the washroom and had to go through some \"acrobatic\" moves to get out of the seat holding up their food tray. Some already fall a sleep before the crew cleared the trays. At breakfast we were served only with a piece of cake and a small serving of fruits and cold coffee. It looked to me there was an empty space on the tray to serve breakfast item but nothing came. I strongly suspect that either they \"forgot\" to serve it or they were too late to serve the entree so skipped it all together. The time between dinner and breakfast was long on a 8 hours 30 minutes flight. No other snacks / drinks were offered in between. Crew totally ignored the call button and my loud enough \"excuse me\" more than twice. Horrible terrible customer service. The crew were a disgrace. I am dreading my 9 hours 35 minutes return flight from Mumbai to London on Sunday 1:40am. If I can help it depending on my schedule I might not fly Jet Airways again. Really disappointed on my recent trip Edmonton to Las Vegas! There were no television screens in the seat backs nor any tablets available to rent. No entertainment was provided whatsoever. Apparently Westjet is moving to this business model of making tablets available to rent for $5 each but only on flights of 3 hr + 20 min or longer. Edmonton to Las Vegas is 3 hr. Passengers weren't informed of this condition until 10 minutes prior to boarding! At the very least Westjet should have posted notice of this \"discount service\" flight online prior to our booking and reduced the price accordingly. Even the smiling joking flight attendants couldn't make up for Westjet's poor judgement. If and when portable tablets are made available for rent here again is another nickle-and-dime scheme from a once reputable airline. New discount airlines can't come soon enough because that's the level of service that we received at Westjet's full-service prices. It was a gruelling long flight from Vancouver to Toronto flight was full and of course no TV movies or music whatsoever. The excuse was its a new aircraft and could not accommodate the system but it was okay to buy the mini screen for your seat at $5 a pop. This should all be included. Price gouging again from WestJet and super- sizing. The staff were friendly bordering on condescending when we all asked to take our seats for most of the flight. 5 hrs is a long time when your fed drinks and food and then told to take a seat since you were not allowed to use the restroom. I write this review from YQR one of the smaller airports in Canada. I further write this as one who travels frequently for both work and personal on this occasion with my husband and 2 children. We arrived at the cut off time for a 5.50 am flight. We were channelled into a line up for manual check-in. Note: for some reason I didn't receive the usual check-in notice 24 hours in advance to do online. I tried to do so but it wasn't allowing. We wait in line for manual check-in with one attendant. She continued to help one family for 20 mins (from the time we arrived). They appeared to be moving their lives from A to B. If we were earlier given the circumstance we still would have been notably late for check-in. No other attendant came over to help check people in. Meanwhile several people missed their flight to Calgary. Remember this is Regina SK. Finally our turn I learn that between 11-13 people per flight are randomly selected for manual check in and unable to do e-check-in. Odds are that 1 in our family of 4 was randomly selected which resulted in our inability to e-check-in. OK we accept missing the flight with the script from the attendant \"there is nothing we can do.\" We later find out that a person who was quite far behind us was accommodated and put on the flight. We had breakfast with the family as we wait 4 hours in Regina to catch a different flight. Long story short: rude service upon initial arrival at airport short staffed at manual check-in no responsiveness from walker by attendants to help our family shuffle along while others appeared to be moved along others behind us accommodated. We received the text book verbiage from the attendant and was one of the more phoney/unauthentic explanations I've received. Disappointed beyond words and will do everything to not fly with WestJet. They apparently pride themselves on customer service. This was everything but customer service. Flew LHR-DEL July 2014. Service was awful. Toilets were dirty. Food served was stale and badly presented. Staff were very apologetic but could do nothing and blamed their caterers. When we landed I wanted to complain but the ground staff said there was nothing they could do. Gave me an email address to write to. I duly wrote to them and nothing since not even an acknowledgement. Never again will I fly this airline. I have been travelling on Westjet for many years now and the definite drop in service reliability and quality is astounding. My last four flights have been delayed with no reasonable explanation as to why (No I am not exaggerating). Yesterday my flight out of Victoria was delayed. When I asked the agent at the counter in Victoria why my last three flights were delayed she was very sarcastic and said I guess you are just unlucky” and turned to chat with another agent! To me that was just an example of Westjets decline in customer service. Imagine my surprise when my connecting flight in Vancouver was also delayed. But it gets better once on the aircraft my seat was full of crumbs the tray was stained with coffee (I paid the 30 dollars for the plus seat) and the entertainment system did not work. Have been travelling Jet Airways business class London-Mumbai frequently since 2005. This year I have been very disappointed. Dirty toilets with non-functional soap-dispensers toasted sandwich snack served cold! Delay in clearing trays to entrap one down seemingly forever poor announcements in the airport lounge area apathetic cabin crew unilaterally working headphones and the last-straw - allocated seats being occupied by \"upgraded\" economy class customers. Poor show all around! SIN-Chennai on 19 July 2014 on 9W21. Flying an international route of Jet after 4 years. Flight was on time. Aged aircraft that should not have been flown on an overseas route. Seats cushions were so thin that it felt like sitting on a metal seat. Leg room was totally inadequate for a 4 hour flight. Wonder if seat pitch was just 29\". Food was reasonably good but standard of service seems to have gone down in the last 4 years. Jet should definitely fly newer planes with better interiors and seat pitch on international routes. Travelled on Jet from Heathrow to Delhi 3 months back. To be honest I don't know the difference between this airline and the poor standards of Air India. The seats were rock hard and cramped and I had to put a pillow underneath. So uncomfortable. Food was very bland and nothing special. Service was slow. The only good thing were the young pretty girls of Jet Airways. I would first mention that I have been a fairly frequent customer of Jet Airways over the last 7 years and generally find the company to be welcoming and efficient. This morning I flew JetKonnect 9W 2348 from LEH to Delhi. JetKonnect appears to be a low-cost arm of Jet Airways though in my opinion it does not seem to be very clearly differentiated from the main company in its marketing. I paid a very high fare for a one-hour flight sector in India. Despite having checked-in on-line the previous day and arriving at the airport 2 hours before the scheduled departure time with a printed boarding pass I had to queue for more than 45 minutes in a poorly managed utterly chaotic check-in area. There was no separate bag drop for already checked-in passengers. On eventually reaching the check-in desk I was told that I was 7 kilos over the 15kg checked-baggage allowance and had to pay an additional INR2000 in excess baggage charges. However I was 1kg under the 7kg cabin baggage allowance. I was invited to transfer 1kg of items from my checked luggage to my cabin baggage in order to save myself 1kg (INR300) excess baggage charge! This was hardly appropriate in the hectic environment and it seemed a nonsense not to combine the checked-baggage and cabin-baggage weight allowance. After all what difference does it make whether the total baggage allowance is carried as cabin or hold baggage? Given the very high fare charged by JetKonnect the hold-baggage allowance of 15kg seemed unreasonably low compared to industry standard of 20kg or 23kg. I was transiting to an international flight on another airline at Delhi airport and my hold-baggage was under-allowance for that flight. In order to complete the excess baggage payment I had to negotiate my way back through the security check-point to the terminal entrance where the Jet Airways ticket desk was located and then repeat the lengthy entry security check to return to the check-in desk. After dropping my checked baggage I proceeded to a long queue at the boarding gate. On eventually reaching the boarding point I was told to go back to a hold-baggage sorting area to identify my bag before it was loaded onto the aircraft. This unusual procedure had not been advised by the check-in agent and I saw numerous other passengers being turned back like myself to complete this task which had not been explained to them. It was therefore no surprise that the departure of the flight was delayed because of hopelessly inefficient ground handling. The flight itself was entirely uneventful but the experience at LEH airport was truly dreadful and judging by the comments of other customers my experience was not isolated. My wife and I traveled from YYC to YYZ on a trip to house hunt and visit friends. First issue was the flight out we had a 20 minute delay due to issues with the plane of course I'm glad they noticed the fuel leak before taking off but at least they could have done something to keep the over heated boring wait a little more enjoyable like hand out free headsets. I'm sure the $1200 for the return flight should cover a $3 (Cost price) headset also on the first flight the TV was jacked and flickering so watching any channel was a waste of time. Flight was \"Sold out\" so I could not change seats. Second issue was on the return flight. Is it ok for a father to encourage their child to scream and shout? I along with everyone in the 6 row radius heard these screaming kids after explaining to the father I don't want to hear your stories I just want a quiet flight back to YYC. I spoke to the stewardess and she just laughed and explained that she couldn't do anything. This was so bad and I had been told by friends who flew WestJet that there not good but I like to judge myself - judgement made. 9W 75 HKG-BOM: They really need to do something about their cabin crew. They had 4 crew serving Economy. The crew were plainly incompetent and not interested. No smiles no greeting no warmth. They were badly groomed. They couldn't bother to serve my VLML meal even though it was listed in their manifest until I had to insist that they search for it. They never came by with a tray of drinks/water for the second time on a 5+ hr flight. They could not be bothered do the pre-flight checks and during take-off and landing. On the plus side the A330-200 cabin was clean leg room was OK not great. Flight was on time and piloting was good. 9W 10 BOM-SIN. First the good news - check-in was quick flight was on time. Next the bad part - they really ought to stop flying a 737-800 for 6 hours on this route. Seats were cramped entertainment was poor and the cabin crew though friendly were pathetic. They did not have the VLML meal that I had pre-ordered and confirmed with them twice before the flight. They forgot to serve the bread with the meal and one lady came by sheepishly with it after people had finished eating. Clearly their cabin crew training standards are dubious so is their catering. We took our first flight with WestJet this year from Toronto to Vancouver and back. On the way to Vancouver we had plus seats. Well that was ok for me as I'm not a very big person however it was not much of a *plus* for my husband who is not as small as I am. However on our return trip we arrived at the airport and found our trip had been cancelled. The reason \"due to a fire drill at the hotel our crew was at they did not acquire the proper amount of sleep\". Keep in mind our flight out of Vancouver was for 3.50pm. They were unable to put us on any other flight and set us to fly out of Vancouver at 10.45pm and not arriving in Toronto until 6.07am the following day. We were given two vouchers from WestJet for $30 each to make up for the inconvenience of our journey. We will never fly WestJet again. Flew with Jet Airways this week Brussels to Newark. Although we had a good experience five years ago on the same leg their service has substantially deteriorated over time. Rude unresponsive flight attendants who could not care less about passengers poor to indecent meal quality chaotic seat allocation (we were a family of 4 and we were scattered all across the A330 online check in the day before departure did not let us reserve seats saying \"no seating available\"). Unhelpful staff at Brussels airport. To sum it up extremely disappointed. Would not fly Jet Airways again and would certainly not recommend. I boarded the Jet flight from Delhi to Heathrow at 1pm. The take off was scheduled for 1.45 but we were informed that there would be a short delay due to a technical glitch. The delay stretched on and we sat on the tarmac until close to 2.45 with no further information. Some lucky passengers got drinks (many did not) and no food was served. Then we were informed that the technical glitch would take several hours and that we would be deplaned. It took another half hour to get us off the plane and then complete chaos reigned. There were no instructions on what to do next or where to go. There were 2-3 Jet ground staff members surrounded by knots of increasingly angry passengers demanding guidance. The Jet ground staff appeared totally clueless on how to handle the situation. One staff member said we would get new boarding passes (not clear where) while another said that the Delhi based folks should go home and come back at 11 for a 2.15 flight. There were many passengers who were from outside Delhi or who were tourists/visitors who had checked out of their hotels - they were told that hotels would be arranged. There was no protocol no clear communication - utter chaos. It went on this way all the way to the airport exit - when I left at 5PM there were still several passengers (including elderly folks) waiting for a coach to take them to a nearby hotel. I have noticed a sharp fall in the service quality at Jet - the staff used to be friendly and competent about 10 years ago but have become brusque dismissive and unpleasant besides increasingly incompetent in recent years. Awful experience. Pearson - LaGuardia: Waited 7 hours at LaGuardia after first flight was cancelled with absolutely no information from Westjet. The staff (frustrated with customers) turn the TV off and walked away from the gate. It would have been nice to have been given information about something like the AA and other flights at the other gates in the area. The staff were also very unfriendly anytime approached. HNL to YVR flight # 1865 departing 10.18 pm June 5th. I hurt my leg and could hardly walk. I had trouble bending my leg. When checking in I asked if there were any empty seats. I was told there were 9. I asked if I could please be seated in a row with an empty seat so I could be in less pain I was told yes and got my boarding pass. When I got to my seat I found my row full and I was crammed in where I could not use my cane and I was in pain. I asked the stewardess if she could help find me a better place to sit. She told me that although there were empty seats throughout the plane there was nothing she could do for me. I spent the next 6 hours in agony. This is the first time I had ever requested this kind of consideration and I am extremely upset that no effort was made to help me. This flight crew seemed tired and in a hurry to have the flight over with. I have been a frequent flyer with Westjet I am going to find another carrier. I do not think I will fly with Westjet again. Round-trip from Toronto to New Delhi via Brussels in May 2014. The plane was on time but the flight attendants were rude. They never smiled or wanted to exchange pleasantries. The seats were cramped and tight. I was traveling with my husband and our journey to New Delhi was completed without much hassle. On our way back to Toronto we were seated in two different seats and was told at the counter that the flights were full and they wouldn't change our seats. On boarding the same rude flight attendants greeted us. The only time we saw them smiling was when we were leaving the plane. On boarding we noticed that it was not only us who were seated separately almost all the couples had the same issue fortunately we were able to exchange seats. This was the same problem on the flight from Brussels to Toronto. The food we received was of substandard quality when compared to other airlines. The fruit tray they served for breakfast had mould on the fruit. The inflight entertainment system had very few movies we listened to our iPod instead. Ground staff at New Delhi Airport were rude and not helpful. They need considerable improvements in organizing their seats and other basic things like training flight attendants to international standards. The lack of inflight entertainment is rather a joke. 3 flights within a week 1 flight none of the TV's worked and then 2 flights and no TV's. There are advertisements for tablets for rental but \"oh they forgot to load them this morning\" is the excuse given each time. I specifically prefer Westjet for the TV's in the back of the seats but seems they are taking these away to force you to purchase tablets. For years I felt they were the best and would only fly Westjet but I guess its time to begin shopping around. I flew from Mumbai to Brussels and did not have a pleasant experience at all. Food items were spoiled coffee cups were not clean. Seats were uncomfortably squeezed in size. Entertainment facilities was good. I will surely think twice before booking jet again. Mumbai to Newark. 15th March and return 22nd April. It is the worst of all Indian carriers. The seats were dirty and the ground staff were unfriendly. The Vegetarian food was awful. The entertainment system feels like it hasn't been updated in the last few years. Pay extra and do not travel on this airline. I flew whilst 30 weeks pregnant with my husband and 2.5 year old toddler from Mumbai to London. The cabin crew were rude - I requested an additional pillow - not available apparently! 2 of the toilets on the flight were out of order but I saw cabin crew using it! Food quantity was pathetic - we had pre-ordered hindu non veg meal - told it was not available when mentioned we had pre-ordered they finally turned up with it. The quality of children's meal was awful. Jet Airways cabin crew made the whole journey unpleasant! I fly the JED-BOM route often on business class. The flight is usually fine without issues. But my question is this: since Jet Airways has the highest ticket prices why can't they afford to hire an airport lounge at Jeddah? Do they really have to use a a quarter photocopied page as a voucher for executive travelers to get a meal at the common cafeteria? I used Jet Airways to go to Singapore for a conference in May 2014. I was disabled this particular trip with a dislocated knee. I was flying Business class and had already placed a special assistance request at the time of booking the ticket. i was also a Jet airways frequent flyer. My experience was so bad / awful that I never want to travel this airline ever again. There was no assistance provided. The wheelchair took forever to come at the Delhi airport. The person pushing the wheelchair left me in the lounge and disappeared. When final call started being announced my father had to push my wheelchair and carry the hand luggage to the flight. On flight and at check in when we asked them if a message had been sent to Singapore for a wheelchair to be available at the landing station but the staff was rude and unhelpful. On flight they were even worse! On the way back the staff at check in at Singapore said they could not get me a wheelchair and scoffed at me and my crutches and told me to walk. The immigration security officer saw me and asked me why I was not being assisted - he not only took me through immigration himself but arranged a Singapore Airport Authority person to get a wheelchair in 2 minutes and assist me. Flight 9W561 and 9W562. SHJ-COK-SHJ. Paid for a full service. Got budget airline service. No inflight entertainment at all. I understand the cost includes that as well. It was not mentioned at any time during the booking. Later found one line tucked in cheekily deep inside their website. Flight 9w0344 on 7th May Baroda to Mumbai. Flight 9W 0120 Mumbai to London Heathrow on 8th May. After asking staff for an extended seatbelt twice I didn't get one so was without a belt from Baroda to Mumbai. Whilst on board from Mumbai to UK we did not get a proper meal we had a snack and breakfast! I had my disabled daughter with me. When going from UK to India she had a wheelchair without any trouble it was not the same coming back. I had to keep asking for one. Very disappointed with the service. Flew from Hong Kong to Kathmandu via Mumbai. The flight to Mumbai was decent but on the way back I was a little taken aback by the service. There were flight attendants shouting at people and when I asked for water I was told very rudely to wait. Mumbai airport was an utter nightmare with men and women searched and separated upon landing not to mention the mosquitoes which were everywhere. I would highly recommend flying via Delhi which we did on the return and it was a more pleasurable experience. Seats were large enough otherwise and food was alright. Would not recommend unless you have a very cheap ticket. Flight from YYZ to YQB was re-directed back to YYZ with only vague explanation about poor conditions (no mention about this prior to leaving Toronto first time we were told was 15 minutes before our expected arrival time in Quebec). I can completely understand that poor weather conditions are not Westjet's fault. However during the same period of time 2 Air Canada flights successfully landed at YQB (one from YUL and another from YYZ) with yet another leaving YYZ for YQB at the time as our plane arrived back in Toronto. Instead of refuelling and heading back to YQB flight was cancelled and we were left to fly the following day delaying arrival by 14 hours for a 1 hour flight. It is clear Westjet does not have the capacity to deal with extenuating circumstances leaving their customers out of luck. Chennai to London via Mumbai. My flight from Mumbai was scheduled to take off at 1.40am IST and land in London at 6.45am GMT. I had planned another flight from London to Stuttgart at 8.45am GMT (2 hours later) keeping in mind check out immigration and check in time. The flight from Mumbai took off 4 hours later at 5.40 in the morning. Now I have been on flights that have been delayed and it is no new experience for me. What was new for me though was the way in which the whole issue was dealt with. The first officer announced 10 minutes before scheduled departure that the flight was being delayed 15 minutes due to maintenance checks. Almost 30 minutes later the Captain came on and said that there were delays and due to a technical check we would be delayed by a further 30 minutes. Almost an hour later we were told that there are even further delays and through out the entire time span the passengers were left absolutely clueless. Never ever before have I been on a flight where the ETA on the flight information screen was only shared with passengers on the Inflight Entertainment 30 minutes before landing. This is the first and the last time that I will fly Jet Airways. YYZ-BRU in economy. Plane was on time facilities were ok staff were hard to find outside service times. The absolute worst thing about the experience were the other passengers. They all seemed to be high-maintenance passengers: really elderly people and many bawling and screaming infants. The children did not stop screaming all the way to and from Brussels. I would have expected this on a low cost charter airline but this took me by surprise. Of course the staff did little or nothing to help keep things calm you just had to grin and bear it or spend the $500 for an upgrade to Premiere class. I just booked a trip from Winnipeg to Las Vegas. The departure and return times are ridiculous that is if you want a direct flight. The departure time is at 21.50 while the return time is at 00.30. Not wanting to return at that time I arranged to switch times and take a later flight in return only to discover that any later flights required a stop over which adds hours onto your travel time. Meanwhile there are more than one direct flight to other cities. Calgary springs to mind where there is one trip at 08.00 and the next around 10.00 or 11.00. A few years ago when I returned from Mexico again having to stop in Calgary many of our companions were immediately able to get on connecting flights while those going to Winnipeg had to wait until the next day which added to our costs. I am beginning to think WestJet has something against Winnipeg because after having to pay $266 for a return flight at a more reasonable time with now a stop in Calgary I am not liking WestJet so much. Flew Calgary-Kamloops return. Paid full price to ride in a tiny airplane called a Q400. It arrived late left late and parked way out on the tarmac in -20c with a wind. No room for Canadians wearing winter clothes nor their luggage. Just booked Westjet to Vegas return - they did not allow the booking agent to seat my wife and I together we were in middle seats different rows. I made this booking a month ago - to change seats is $90. Air Canada does allow spouses booking at the same time to sit together no charge. Westjet has lost its way. My expectations of better service are gone. BOM-LHR on 30 March 2014 flight was not so pleasant. Flight departed Mumbai at lunchtime 1pm however lunch was served 2 hours later by which time everyone is starving and hungry. 1 hour into the flight 1 drink and packet of peanuts. Lunch was ok though portion size was very small. During the flight there were 3 rounds of drinks 1 serving per round rest of the time the air hostesses were never around. The final meal was a measly croissant as the main dish. Still not enough for an average human. All in all a starving flight and I arrived hungry. Inflight system was mediocre and leg room is just adequate. In case you want to have a comfortable flight Jet airways is not the flight its definitely not going to be mine. My husband flies 4 times a month from Edmonton to Vancouver and Westjet is always late so he always chooses AC but now we are moving and the only direct option is Westjet. Today was his first flight with this airline in ages and it's already 45 minutes late. I'm really hoping a new carrier comes in locally. Took a return flight from Toronto to Mumbai via Brussels. Positive: In all 4 sectors the flights were generally on time. Only minor delays. Negative: 1) Cramped seats 2) Non-working ear-phones in two sectors 3) Indifferent attitude of in-flight crew towards passengers 4) Poor or non existent movie options in major Indian regional languages 5) Sloppy in-flight service. 6) Can not input your frequent flyer # in manage your booking. 7) Website is not very user friendly 8) Complaints are not looked into properly. I would not fly again. I have traveled Westjet since it first started flying in 2006. I have always been proud to fly this Calgary based Airline in Canada. I fly frequently 5-6 times a year and it was on a flight from Calgary-Toronto that I was bumped into Plus Seats which was great. However on my return flight from Ottawa a week later I was back in economy seating as I had purchased economy for both inbound and outbound but when I sat down I had to squeeze myself into the seat. This has never been a problem before and I was sitting at the bulkhead on the 737-6 so I requested to move from a flight attendant. I am 6'4\" so flights have always been a little tight but this was like nothing I have experienced. The flight attendant accommodated my request to the seats in front of the exit row that don't recline. Same problem when the person in front of me put their seat back. I again requested to move into and the only seats available were in the exit row mid-cabin which was empty but I was told I couldn't sit there as they were Plus Fare seats. I was shocked! I can't help being tall and had I known I would have purchased a plus fare in Ottawa. The flight attendant did not allow me to sit anywhere else and it was by far the worst flight I have been on. I contacted Westjet with my disappointment and received a standard auto-generated letter back. If you are over 6ft tall and/or have legs longer than 32inches BUY PLUS FARE. I however will be flying another Canadian Airline (AC) from now on as their seat pitch is what Westjet's used to be in economy and are no extra charge. Big mistake. Goa to Mumbai economy. We were upgraded to Premiere as there was a double booking for our seats. Short flight so meal service began immediately after cruising. The pursers were selectively asking passengers for meal choices. Those left were told no non -veg options only a veg option left. I refused and he asked me if I wanted fruit or dessert I declined and asked for tea. After every passenger was served their meals and their coffee tea service in trays one of the crew dumped a cup of tea on my tray. Considering I had asked for one item I would have expected a tea tray offered at the same time as the other service. Anyway I really do not expect much from the arrogant and indifferent crew having had bad experiences in the past with Jet we only fly them on short flights. Toronto Person flight 2742 to Liberia Costa Rica. Flight delayed over an hour. Return Liberia Costa Rica flight 2743 to Toronto first thing in the morning I log on to WestJet website to check the flight status flight not found. Went to the airport and told that flight 2743 is now flight 4343. We board the plane and flight attendants inform everyone we are going to Mexico. WestJet changed the flight number from 2743 to 4343 but they did not import the passengers’ data from 2743 into 4343. Now you have passengers who paid for seat selection and Plus services and they are not getting what they paid for. I need an aisle seat for a medical issue and I need to get up a move around. Instead of getting an aisle seat I found myself in the middle seat. Recently my wife and I flew from Calgary to Honolulu with a change of planes in Vancouver. The flight from Calgary to Vancouver took the usual one hour or so. However our flight from Vancouver to Honolulu took an hour longer than I had experienced on past flights. I find it very annoying that despite the excess charges levied on us unfortunate travellers for baggage seat selection and no decent food we are forced to sit in uncomfortable conditions for another hour while the airline reduces speed to save on fuel! Flew from Montreal to Turks and Caicos. Tickets for this 4 hour RT flight were $1350 but the service was like we booked a cut-rate airline. On the flight out they kept us on the runway from 11.30-2.30 while dealing with fuel line issue and during this time served us 2 very small cookies. They then flew us to Toronto to get to a plane that could fly farther and served en route only alcohol or water. The flight was full of starving kids who had been on the plane for 4 hours but we were told no food or other drink because flight to Toronto \"too short.\" We were in seats in front of the exit row which did not recline and we were not warned about this. For the flight back we could not check-in online because they wanted to charge us extra for our seats on the way out even though our seat selection said zero dollars when we chose it. On the flight itself in-flight entertainment broken meals were cold sandwiches and by the third row they were out of all sandwiches except turkey. On arrival in Montreal there was no attendant to connect that plane to the gate so the pilot had to call for one. Ten minutes later we saw him scampering up the ladder to the gate. Then they let us off but no one had opened the door from the gate hallway to the airport so another 10 minutes there. Then about 20 bags came out then a 20 minutes delay with nothing then the rest of the bags. Flew Pune-Delhi-London. Constant changes to schedule meant that I had less than an hour to transfer in Delhi instead of three which is not enough to get through the Indian airport rubber stamping fiesta. Was not informed of this via email or phone only found out when I checked my booking 3 weeks before departure. Had to change the date since the Pune-Delhi flight I was going to take was cancelled and they refused to book me on another airline for my original date. Flight crew are unfriendly food is inedible (pink rice with brown sauce from the look of it). The seat in front of you reclines right into your face inflight entertainment has long and repeated ads. Fly any other airline to and from India if you can. Flight to and from Cancun no TV's there or back. Flight took 7 hours 45 minutes return with no explanation. Very unpleasant flight will consider other carriers next vacation. My onward connection from Delhi to Amritsar was delayed by approx 5 hours. The staff in the airport were not proactive. They were not explaining the problems and we had to keep going to the desk to ask on if there were further delays (started as 3 hours delayed and then was subsequently moved out by 30 min increments). On the way back the Amritsar to Delhi flight was delayed by 20 mins and passport control in Delhi is poor cumbersome and slow (only 3 staff for 6 counters). The Jet Airways staff were randomly pushing some passengers up the queue to the annoyance of other Jet Airways passengers on the same flight and Air India passengers too. In the end I had to run to gate for boarding due to incompetence. One way Vancouver - Calgary trip and I paid for \"plus seating\". When asked to pre-board the line in Vancouver was huge and I couldn't seem to get the gate agents to care much. Even though I was seat number 2 in \"plus seating\" there was no room for my half-filled \"fits in the tester box\" bag and they let people on with massive pieces of luggage. So much so that I counted at least 30 pieces of luggage that had to be checked in at the gate. This caused a 20 minute delay even though it could have easily been avoided earlier. The flight attendant was tired and gruff. The flight itself was OK but the entertainment system is poor - half the channels don't work and the screens are tiny. \"Plus seats\" have more leg room but are still narrow. Once we disembarked I wait another 20 minutes for \"checked baggage\". 40 minutes late for a 1.25 hour business flight is not adequate. I will not book with WestJet again. I fly about two times a year and always book WestJet due to their \"customer service\". The last two times I have booked with WestJet I've been disappointed. Going from YEG airport to Las Vegas and on the way home the TV's were not working. That is one of the major reason we pay extra to book with WestJet. Makes the flight a lot easier lets face it no one enjoys flying. The next flight I booked with WestJet my departure was at 7.30am I arrived to the airport at 6.10 and they would not let me board. I missed my flight even though I was 1hr and 20 mins early. The lady that was dealing with my flight had no compassion and when I asked her if there was anything WestJet could do she simply said no and it would cost another $80 to re-book with a different flight. Most of the times the plans aren't on time and we just have to deal with it. I was just very disappointed with the way WestJet treated me and do not believe they are worth the cost of their flights. 30 January 2013 flight 9W10 from Mumbai to Singapore (Business Class). Technical problems with plane resulted in an hour delay. Repairs were attempted while on runway and after again trying to depart plane was moved to another part of runway close to airport building. We were parked there for 6 hours. During that time absolute mayhem took place. For the first few hours there were no communication and it became clear this airline has no contingency plan and should not be flying. As business class passengers we received no support and passengers were physically prevented from leaving the plane though we were about 25 metres away from an airbridge. Half the plane without connections were put on another plane to Singapore and we were kept detained on the plane for another few hours. Eventually a Customer Service Manager appeared. We were then told it would take 3 days before we could fly due to tickets not being available. After insisting on tickets it took another hour before we were offered economy class tickets which were rejected. After another hour we were offered premium class tickets to Bangkok and then Melbourne. The flight was 2 am and we were offered a hotel room which I had to share with a stranger. I was very relieved to get on Thai Airlines from Bangkok. As for Jet Airways I will never fly with them again! Flew Edmonton to Comox Jan 17. Pilot made 2 attempts to land in Comox but had to abort so went back to Edmonton. The pilot provided very little info except to make announcement that we were returning to Edmonton. As a passenger this was very confusing. The only info from flight attendants was that we could make alternate arrangements once we were back in Edmonton. Once we got back to Edmonton the passengers waited in one line for almost one hour not moving then all directed to the check-in area where we waited almost 2 more hours with very little progress. I finally called Westjet and made alternate plans to fly to Vancouver late that night. January 2014 London to New Delhi with return from Mumbai. Design of seats meant that legroom was perhaps more acceptable than many airlines provide in economy. Flights were on time. That is the good bit. On the other side of the coin the flight crew were unfriendly. They did what they had to but with no sense of enjoying their jobs. No assistance given to those who needed help with luggage. They just stood and watched whilst other passengers helped out. Very strange and in contrast to the general attitude we encountered during a delightful holiday in India. Poorest food on a long haul flight since Delta served up something inedible about 15 years ago. Entertainment way behind the competition. We will certainly return to India but it won't be on Jet Airways. Dec 31st 2013 me and my family went on a vacation trip to Aruba thinking it would be a very relaxing time and it was until the return to Toronto. Because of weather conditions the plane that was scheduled to go to Aruba to pick up and bring back the passengers from flight 2699 never arrived Tuesday Jan 7th 2014. After an entire day trying to call and get an answer from the airline finally with got to speak with somebody from Westjet who only said that there would not be a rescue flight later that week but passengers had to wait until Tuesday Jan 14th 2014 to get our fight back home but they were not responsible for any expenses until that day. In my case we had to take a flight Aruba-Curacao and Curacao-Trinidad and Trinidad-Toronto with all the expenses it caused in airplane tickets meals and hotel. Please be very careful if buying tickets from this company. Passengers travelling business class are looking for four things in my opinion: First peace and quiet. Jet Airways flight 9W 0118 on 31 December 2013 from Mumbai to London had two kids in the section who did not have a seat of their own and shared seating with 4 adults spread through out the cabin during the entire duration of the flight. The kids screamed the place down and ran amok throughout the cabin. I could not sleep at all on a nearly 10 hour flight. Second. The lounge experience. Lousy is the best description I can come up with. Both outward flight from London and Return flight from Mumbai lounges were shared and were poor at best. Third entertainment. My seat 11A had a non functioning screen! It was locked in a position in which nothing could be viewed. The cabin crew apologised but obviously could do nothing about it. Meal choices. Very limited. And finally cabin comfort. The cabin is laid out in herring bone fashion the fold flat bed does not accommodate a 1.85 meter man. the décor is old fashioned in beige and brown. Shame on you Jet. Old planes indifferent service and clearly unaware that there is competition on this leg. You really do not expect me to be on board your aircraft again. The food is terrible. We thought the price was good but you have to pay for everything (reserve a seat meal movies etc). Finally it's not so cheap. They are not well organized and they made us wait for a family (for an extra hour) - when we make sure to be on time. Inside the plane is dirty. It was our first experience with Westjet and I will never choose this company again. The TVs were not working coming back: with kids the flight was long! The service offered by Jet Airways is very disappointing I was taking a domestic flight from Bengaluru to Kolkata on 18 December 2013. When I checked-in I was told my luggage had exceeded the limit of 15kg. While I understand that such limits are imposed on domestic flights but for someone who is on a long business trip in India who has been allowed up to 20kg or 30kg on international flights how do the authorities expect us to shed off excess weight when flying from one city to the next within India? I was asked to pay for the exceeded amount at a Jet Airways counter. When I went to the counter the service was extremely slow. The counter staff were more interested in attending to the sale of tickets. Onboard there is lack of discipline by staff. People were still talking on their phone after the announcement was made not to do so. This is the second time I have flown on Jet Airways. Their lack of interest in the well being of the passengers is worrying. I will never fly Jet Airways again if I can help it. BRU-BOM on 9th of November. Pretty surprised of the high standards and professionalism of Jet Airways. Food was very tasteful well presented and plenty. On top of that we were served by an extremely friendly crew. Return flight DEL-BRU the 1st December was completely the opposite though. Before takeoff menus were distributed and you had to give your choice. I hardly had the chance to look at the menu when the rude stewardess said I had to make my choice. Once my choice made she grabbed the menu out of my hands and took it back. Food was the most terrible I ever had on a flight. The refreshment was tiny and extremely spicy and was served as good as cold. Breakfast even was worse with a few slices of tasteless unripe fruit smashed on a plate followed by a cold omelette and 2 hard cold greasy discs that were expected to be hash brown potatoes! Just as with the refreshment served earlier presentation was inexistent and looked like everything was just smashed on the plate. I told the stewardess this was the worst meal I ever had on a plane. She apologized and offered me cereals instead this was business class! The only positive point were the flat bed seats. Flying from Bangkok to Delhi Jet Airways offers a business class on their B737 which could not even be compared to an Economy Deluxe Class in other airlines: old seats with reduced pitch lousy entertainment system (tiny overhead screens image so dark it cannot be seen) no toiletries food very average crew indifferent disappears after serving breakfast does not come back if more coffee is needed water is not offered during flight a miserable experience all in all but you can learn from experiences and so I will never fly Jet Airways again. If this is India's best airline I cannot imagine how other airlines fare. Never fly Heathrow to Hyderabad connecting in Mumbai - it is too tight a connection. Flew with my 12 year old daughter after baggage reclaim two security checks check in again and baggage scans we were put on a coach to transfer to Mumbai domestic. With 25 minutes left for Mumbai Hyderabad flight I struggled to find the gates no one knew and there was no Jet staff to help. Finally waited at yet another security queue (no one paged) to arrive at wrong gate where they said I had missed the flight and should go to counters outside who would put me on a flight in next two hours - it was an absolute fish market. They said all flights were full I should buy a ticket for next day morning and make my own stay arrangements. it took me standing 6 hours of perseverence at the counter pleading without any food and with my 12 year old in tears. They initially put me on a waiting list and firmed finally with half an hour to go for the flight to Hyderabad which was a Jet Konnect no frills flight where I bought sandwiches and coffee for dinner. Not worth the hassle I want to give up my Jet Privilege membership and never fly Jet again. My flight from Dubai to Delhi was bad in more than one way the seats were torn glass holders broken restroom dustbins pasted with tapes and no in-flight entertainment. My return flight from Delhi to Dubai was in equally shabby condition (I think it was the same plane). What was worse is that they ran out of juice in the mid of first serving. I wanted to fill out a customer feedback form but I wasn't served one. SIN-DEL return. Singapore to Delhi was horrible. Seats were not reclining and very uncomfortable. They had little leg space. There was no IFE SIN to DEL. Staff friendly from SIN to DEL but on return journey it was exactly opposite. Food was good warm and tasty. Traveled from Dubai to Mumbai on 31st October 2013. Past experiences were very good but this time it was very bad experience as far as entertainment food and beverages are concerned. Asked Air-hostess to replace defective headset and told she would come back with replacement which never happened. Secondly Drinks served only once asked for another drink and was flatly refused. Asked for something for munching with drinks was told its finished and the most surprising part is after completion of all services when I opted to go for wash room was amazed to see team leader eating the snacks that I was told is finished. Food of average quality. Looks like the standard has reached the lowest level. Traveled from Mumbai to London in 2005 using Jet airways. It was an excellent experience. This time again travelled from London to Mumbai and return via Delhi in September 2013. Horrible experience as far as food and beverages are concerned. Drinks served only once. Food of average quality. Looks like the standard has reached the lowest level and now Jet Airways can be compared to Air India. Had recently taken a flight through Emirates which was wonderful. Will not fly Jet anymore. I traveled business class London - Mumbai and was least impressed with the dowdy looking cabin with a dark brown trim around the upholstery and an equally dreary floor carpet. There were absolutely no frills attached. The staff welcome on board was pretty ordinary the cabin crew was not a head turner in terms of uniform smartness and otherwise. It was a day flight and hence the staff did not bother to offer the complementary packs containing the usual toiletry goodies proudly given by other better known airlines. Food presentation was mediocre and I had to ask for a tooth pick as a request. Headphone sets were tucked away in a blue pouch and something that could have easily been forgotten had I not asked for one. Not much of complimentary drinks offered during the flight unless specifically asked for. Oh and the menu cards were collected at the end for re-use again. I guess not a bad think for being environmentally friendly. You get what you pay and it was the cheapest business class that was on offer. I Was on flight from Winnipeg to Calgary on Sep 19th at 7.15 am. I dozed off I woke up later and noticed that everyone was having snacks. I approached an attendant and asked if I could get my snack. Told that they would bring me a glass of tomato juice which I asked for. This was the second flight where I encountered not so friendly staff members. Funny though is that as we landed the crew all had smiles. Despite Westjet's incredibly high self appraisal the services I received was remarkably poor. No TV screen on the seat. If you want to watch anything you have to pay to obtain portable TV. For a 5.5 hour flight they only offered beverages twice with a tiny package of cookies or corn chips. Too much air conditioning but no blanket offered for night time flight. The most offensive service was the fact they put garbage magazines such as People or Star in the front pocket. I guess they assume all the passengers have very low IQ's to enjoy such a tasteless entertainment. This is actually 100 times worse than no entertainment. I recommend Air Canada over Westjet. Had a ticket for a trip from Jaipur to Delhi in India at 8.35 September 3. When I wanted to check in I was informed that there was a delay of 3 hours due to \"technical problems\". The real reason was that there was not enough passengers for this departure so they just chose to merge this departure with the next 35 hours later. The result being that I lost my connection in Delhi and had to arrange new flight connections out of Delhi. I will never ever fly with Jet Airways. Flew SIN-DEL just last month. The Business Class was out so I was stuck with economy. It was awful. The plane looks horrible the cabin was noisy headphones barely audible and the meal tasted bland. The FAs looked like they're on a bad mood or something because the \"threw\" the meal to me instead of serving it nicely. The English announcement need improvement as well. The legroom was also not enough as I'm 5'7\". For a 5 hour flight it was overall horrible. LA to Vancouver in premium economy. Due to a hand injury I asked a flight attendant to assist me with lifting my carry-on luggage to the overhead bin. The flight attendant was unwilling to help and replied that she also had a hand injury. When I asked her again she offered to check my luggage. I declined her offered and explain that my luggage is not heavy but due to a hand injury I have limited range of hand motion and showed her the hand with the hand brace on. She replied again that she also had a hand injury and just stood there. It wasn't until I asked her for another flight attendant to help me that she suggested that we put the luggage up together. I was polite and respectful throughout the entire conversation was surprised at the level of service I was receiving. I will not fly with them again. Outbound Toronto (YYZ) - Liberia (LIR) July 19 2013 Flight 2742 Boeing 737-700. Return Liberia (LIR) - Toronto (YYZ) July 26 2013 Flight 2743. West Jet has One of our worst experiences yet. Firstly they noted we had to upgrade our seating to sit next to each other having to pay more because only front seats were available. Rather than just being seated in any back row told not a single seat was left but the front ones even though we had booked our flight months in advance. Had to pay almost an extra hundred for our seats. Also they do not offer any earphones for use and they offer very little channels to watch during flight. They also don't offer any meals you have to buy everything. You are only offered a drink (water pop or coffee/tea) and a biscuit. We were extremely disappointed having to pay the extra hundred for our flight! Toronto to Victoria on July 10 2013. Only TV on the plane that didn't work was mine! Attendant came and tapped it a few times and nothing but showed no real concern its only a 5 hour flight!! We were row 5 I had specifically picked those seats and paid extra for them but at the time they were not deemed 'undesirable' unfortunately now they were and when the row in front reclined we lost use of our trays and the only 1 TV that was working which we were sharing! It was a bad situation and a horrible flight. When the food and beverage services started I passed the attendant my visa and asked to run a tab the other attendant said it wouldn't be any charge for my cheese platter due to the problems we were having with that the attendant said 'now are you happy'. I fly regularly on Westjet and have noticed a change from before certainly not going to be my go to airline anymore getting the poor service is one thing upsetting my daughter due to complete ignorance is another. 4 hour flight to Hamilton from Calgary and no TV or entertainment system. Paid $900 round trip. Will be flying Air Canada from now on. Traveling with my small daughter between Mumbai-Delhi flight. Flight was bit uncomfortable and food below par. Found inflight staff quite rude and uncooperative. Overall experience - not satisfied. Booked return flight Delhi-Amritsar. Both the flights were delayed by around 4 hours. The return flight delay caused me to miss my connecting flight. The cabin crew and the staff at the airport were extremely rude and refused help of any kind. Talking around the Delhi airport it seems this is common occurrence for Jet Airways - almost all their flights are delayed. PNQ-BOM-LHR-DEL-PNQ. Jet Airways continues to slide in just about all aspects. What once used to be a premium global carrier is now nothing more than a 2 star airline. Seat configuration on LHR sector to 3-4-3 has made seats very cramped. Food is distasteful aircraft's are unclean landings on all sectors was rough. Flew DEL-BOM-DEL. Air conditioning turned on only after reaching cruise altitude and turned off when landing. Food was pathetic service average. Sufficient seating space at the gate. Check in was smooth. Note that there is no baggage drop counter at Delhi airport. If there is one it wasn't clearly visible. Bombay airport was good. Return flight Singapore and Delhi. SIN to Delhi leg was pleasant not great. Delhi to Singapore was awful. Food was poor but the clincher must be when they raised the air-conditioning temperature because they ran out of blankets. For a 5 hour long red-eyed flight where you would be trying to get some sleep it was hot. Crew were unable to help as they said that passengers felt cold and there were insufficient blankets to go around. First time on Jet Airways and last. Only thing salvageable were the crew. Flew a short return hop to/from Saskatoon and Calgary for business. Outgoing flight was 45 mins late boarding and then 30 mins late on tarmac from the time I left my house to arriving at my hotel was 7 hours. Return flight was also over 30 mins late. I will use a different airline next time for sure! I travelled from SIN-DEL-SIN. Small plane. Not enough leg room. Crew were doing their best given circumstances. Lavatories awful. There were only 2 on the return. One non operational on both flights. With one lavatory operational there was long queue in the aisle. My kids were also booked to fly on Jet Airways domestic flight. It was cancelled twice on the day. 7am flight from DEL to CHD ended up being 4pm flight for a mere 30 minutes journey. I really want to be a WestJet fan but it's just getting harder and harder. Their in-flight entertainment was a great idea for a small regional carrier but does not work that far away from Canada. All staff used to be very well trained and knowledgeable. We were recently asked to re-pack because 2 of our cases where 1 pound overweight. I forethought I should have insisted to just pay the overage and had them do the paperwork. My daughter likes the soup they serve but there's about a 50% chance they will run out. Prices have risen as well as service charges. Aside from a couple most of the staff have great attitudes and that is refreshing but really it seems as though that about all the have left going for them anymore. Outgoing flight to Mumbai was ok - attentive cabin crew and food was a good standard. Connecting flight to Bangkok nowhere near as good as the earlier flight. Food not very nice. Return flight from Bangkok to Mumbai - very poor cabin crew - I asked for water several times and it never arrived. The attitude of one of the female attendants was unacceptable! The food was awful some sort of omelette. Seats very worn and terrible vibration. The connecting flight to Heathrow was slightly better but I just wanted to get home. I would not recommend Jet airways and will avoid using them again. On the plus side the take off and landings were very smooth. Flight from Lihue to Vancouver - 5.5 hour overnight flight. Lots and lots of small children (including ours) but no inflight entertainment! No mention if you could rent anything but lots of raggedy magazines available - not a great diversion for an over tired 2 year old. Round trip to Las Vegas from Edmonton. I was very surprised how neglected the cabin was. The seats were not clean the seat pockets not clean dirt on carpet bathroom not clean. Also my friend sat on a broken seat making noise the whole flight. It is really sad as we loved to travel with Westjet in the past and now it has changed. New Delhi - Dubai - New Delhi 2 Passengers. We arrived at check-in 2 hours early yet we were given seats in the last row of the plane. They were so uncomfortable yet one still has to pay the same for them. Our seats were non reclining and you are barely left with space to breath when the seat in front reclines. One of our seat's entertainment screen wasn't working there was no one to fix it in spite of complaining. Other problems included crying babies stench of the toilet people shouting arguing with the attendants for alcohol beyond the allowed limit queues outside the toilet throughout and passengers ignoring the seat belt sign. I've given the staff service good reviews since they tried their best to manage things. However they could not do much with the overall quality of resources. Neither plane nor services were international quality. DEL-HYD-BOM-DEL. Each flight delayed by more than an hour due to 'weather in Delhi' though all other airlines operating on time. Received SMS that the flights were delayed 10 min before boarding which is useless. On board service spotty with the crew more concerned about applying makeup and chatting. You get a tiny cup of water and that's it - have to pay for everything else. Planes have clearly had rows of seats added as there is little to no space between rows. The worst part however was the ground staff. Check in at BOM with rude and uninformed agents who could not checks bag onto ANA codeshare flight to NRT which resulted in a 2 hour ordeal at DEL to get back go through security wait for check in counter to open and recheck bag in again. This airline has gone downhill - will use Indigo next time. LHR-BOM on newly configured B777-300. Terrible. Reconfigured to 3-4-3 there is really not enough width to sit comfortably and the still advertised foot rests have been removed. Under seat is also filled with obstacles to stretching out which all makes for a most uncomfortable flight. Flight attendants were hiding from customers pre-flight as they seem to be bored of all the complaints - they didn't even do a seatbelt check. Food passable in flight entertainment is actually reasonable. But overall a great disappointment. Flew from Saskatoon to Orlando this month. Every flight left a minimum of 30 minutes late! Was given the wrong gate number on my boarding pass and almost missed my connection on the way home because of it. But in this instance the flight leaving late yet again worked in my favor so that I wasn't stuck in the airport overnight. Boarding process is kind of a free for all. Other airlines will allow boarding from the back of the plane forward so as not to cause all the passengers to try to board at once. Very disappointed in WestJet and I will be looking at different/more reliable airlines from now on. Flew from Toronto YYZ to Vancouver YVR return. Staff were friendly but the entertainment system was a nightmare the same movies both ways and not many choices. Whenever I moved my TV up or down it would go black. The screens are tiny. They didn't seem to notify me that snacks were coming and just passed me by. I will choose Air Canada next time. Our flight from Las Vegas to Edmonton was delayed several hours. No explanation given to us. The seats were quite average/uncomfortable. The entertainment system at my seat didn't work for the entire flight. However crew members were very nice. Not sure why the delay happens this often. Currently sitting at terminal 2 LAX waiting to return to Vancouver on a flight that was supposed to leave at 7.30 but has been delayed to 9.15. This on top of the fact we were not only charged the extra baggage fee for second bag but an additional $50 for oversize. That being our bike bags which are streamlined sleek and weigh approximately 20 pounds each. Our flight last Tuesday morning from Vancouver was also delayed an hour and a half but at least they didn't charge the oversize fee in addition to the second bag fee. The reason for the delay here as explained by the very unsympathetic Westjet supervisor is they are re-fitting the aircraft. Hard to understand why we should be paying for that with our time. 1.5 hour delay. The first story was weather delays. That didn't pass muster so then it was passenger delays 20 passengers were delayed and wouldn't be able to get out of one of the departure locations for two days so they held the flight and there were head winds on another flight that day. Couldn't get their story straight. It all adds up to obfuscation and lack of reliability. As one passenger said if you advertise a schedule you should do your very best to keep to it. We flew from Victoria on Nov 10 returning 17th. Flight down was late and ran out of food - overheard flight attendants complaining about lack of stores onboard. The 2.5 hour wait through immigration was outside of Westjet's control. Return flight was delayed 4 sandwiches for the entire cabin we were in row 10 and the last two bottles of white wine were gone on the first pass. The worst was the high cabin temperature. While the staff tried the plane was not equipped properly. DEL-PNQ Economy Class. After pre-reserving a window seat I was told rudely on request at boarding that 'only middle seats were available'. Only after much insistence with the sour-faced check-in attendant and asking several times to speak with the check-in supervisor was at least an aisle seat made available to me. Then I was told that as my luggage was 23 kgs I would have to pay for excess. It seemed to me that this was punishment for my causing a fuss. Inflight it seems to me that Jet Airways once nice planes are tired cramped and in desperate need of a refurbishment. In-flight service the service was okay but not what it was once. I have enjoyed flying with Jet Airways in the past but will now look into Indigo and Spicejet for domestic Indian flights. LHR-BOM-BKK 4th Nov 2012. Flight 2 hours late departing plane not very clean and entertainment system faulty. Food terrible and crew service not up to international standards. Toilets ran out of facial tissues and were dirty obviously not checked on during the flight. Information on our late arrival not available. At BOM no pier so stairs and bus to Terminal. Onward flight rescheduled so made it to Bangkok where Bangkok Airways flight also held for us for onward to Koh Samui. On arrival at Koh Samui our luggage did not arrive due to inefficiency of Jet Airways. Flew Business Class on YYZ-BRU-MAA on 9/10 Nov. YYZ-BRU was ok. BRU-MAA was not up to satisfaction. No priority boarding at BRU. No aerobridge at MAA and the business class passengers get crushed with the economic class passengers on the bus ride from the aircraft to the terminal. No Priority baggage delivery. I was probably the last one to get my priority luggage. No wonder they have cancelled the MAA-BRU flight. November 10/12 Victoria to Cancun. First time flying WestJet. Bare bones 6hr flight with 3hr line up at Cancun customs too many WestJet flights arriving at the same time. Poor scheduling. Will think twice before flying again. Flew from Victoria BC Canada to Cancun and flew back two weeks later. Friendly service. On time Plenty of luggage allowance. Food minimal and had to be paid for except a tiny snack. Drinks - two soft drinks free - 6 hr flight! Main complaint - long flight - two films only. (So 3 hrs no entertainment). Then amazingly same films on the way back. Flight was not cheap. Boasted of satellite TV did not work in either direction and I suspect it never does. Disappointed to say the least. LHR-DEL-BLR economy. Airport check in was smooth at all the airports the seats and IFE are very good. Unfortunately the food was ridiculous although dinner was ok breakfast which is supposed to be the main meal of the day had only a medium size muffin bowl of fruits and an orange juice. Flight attendants are rude and do not attend calls properly. I had asked for a drink she openly told me to fetch it from the galley. Jet has a lot to learn from other airlines about service and food quality. I flew Westjet from Hamilton to Edmonton. The flight was ok the crew were rude and not helpful! You should fly if you are desperate for a cheap price! Westjet sorry is not as good as it used to be. Still enjoy the cabin service but not enjoying the \"rules are rules\" attitudes at the ticket counters. They are the same as any airline now looking for any chance to charge extra fees even when they could accommodate at no loss to themselves. Used to fly Westjet even if they were higher than other airlines but now because Westjet is just the same as any airline I'll just fly the lowest price. Flew HKG-BOM-HKG. Aircraft on the HKG-BOM leg was the Boeing 777 normally used for the London leg and not the Airbus which is the norm. Initial HKG-BOM leg was fair though the cabin could have been cleaner and more information could have been provided about a delay that was explained only after 35mins (a fire alarm) was malfunctioning in the cargo hold. The return BOM-HKG is the reason I will never fly Jet Airways again. Check in staff unaware that a Lufthansa Senator card is acceptable as Lufthansa is a partner airline. Be prepared for lacklustre service. The LHR-BOM leg is much better on Air India and the HKG-BOM leg is better served by Cathay Pacific. Milan to Mumbai via Delhi. Booked seats on 8th row. At Check in 24th row was allocated. No explanation or apology provided. On board the inflight entertainment system did not work. Got the system reloaded twice but still didn't work. A Cabin Crew member transferred us to the last row. After some time another Cabin Crew member told us to change seats as our current seats were reserved only for cabin crew members. Cabin Crew courteous until you ask them for a second drink. For breakfast were served a muffin! Do Not recommend Jet Airways. Jet Airways Privilege is supposed to be there to reward customers but our experience is that the airmiles upgrade system is a mess and full of silly out of date quotas. Recently my wife and I paid to transfer some air miles from our children's accounts. We both applied for upgrade from economy to business class. I was awarded an upgrade but my wife was put on a waiting list. After one week on the waiting list we took off with my wife still in economy class whilst I sat in business class. There were 9 seats occupied but 7 seats still empty in business class. When I have queried these empty seats they tell my they have a policy of restricting the number of upgrade seats available. Also to rub to make matters worse there was no way of checking whether upgrade seats were available before we had to pay for the JetPrivilege miles. What a shambles. Flew Westjet from Toronto Canada to Santa Clara Cuba on 09/15/2012 returning 09/22/2012. We have flown Westjet before however it was an inauguration flight and had received amazing service. Little did we know that the inauguration service does not apply to all flights so we decided to go with Westjet Vacations. To be fair their aircraft have the most leg room compared with the other Canadian charter airlines. The entertainment consisting of Canadian TV channels was not working on both flights. I do understand that airlines want to save money on catering however all other charters except Air Canada and Westjet do offer hot meals on their flights. Westjet dares to give you the choice between a 100g snack pack or 2 miniature cookies (do not dare asking to have them both). The only check flight attendants seem to do is to make sure seat belts are on. Moving forward I will make sure when booking a package that the flight is with Air Transat Canjet or Sunwing. I flew from Montreal to Toronto with Westjet on a KLM codeshare two days ago and when I arrived in Toronto although they announced it would only take 20 minutes for our baggage to be deposited on the carrousel for pick up it took over an hour thereby resulting in my missed connecting flight and had to stay the night in Toronto at a hotel. No one at the airport in Toronto could help me and one Westjet worker at the baggage area even told me I should have informed them that I had a tight connection and they would have sent them to Moncton (my final destination) with the next Westjet flight even though I was connecting with Air Canada. This was completely astonishing and untrue. When has it ever been ok for you to leave your bags and go on a flight with a different carrier and expect the other carrier to send your bags along. Anyway all Westjet reps I spoke with at Pearson told me to call the 1-800 number on the website which I did and I was told that 2 hours is not enough time for a connection with a domestic flight. Finally I called back again and spoke to someone who offered me a $200 travel credit with them. So in all I had a terrible experience with customer service with Westjet who tried to pass things off to others and no one would accept responsibility for their mistakes. 4 return tickets for LHR-BOM-TRV four months before travel for a family holiday with children in Aug-Sept. Nearer to the travel date Jet Airways changed their flight schedule that extended the connection time in BOM to 23 hours. The alternative route through DEL with a stopover in Bangalore. We agreed to this reluctantly. 2 days before travel they made it worse by changing the re-routed schedule necessitating a change of plane in Bangalore. Web check-in was not possible. On outwards and return flights the seats allocated were scattered across the plane. When we landed at TRV they told us our baggage will arrive 24 hours later as they had lost them in Bangalore. They first agreed to deliver the bags to our hotel the next evening but they changed their mind a day later. The hotel manager had to send a car to the airport to collect the bags. Jet Airway's international operations used to be better than this. They cancel flights at short notice if the load factor does not meet their targets leaving passengers to suffer and knowingly leaving bags out during connections in order to depart quickly. DEL-SIN. The seats are very small (for Europeans) the staff were overwhelmed and not very friendly. The plane was old Boeing 737-300 and not clean as expected. The serviced food isn't worth a word. Partly cold no choice no tea no bun. Unfortunately the inflight entertainment was only in Indian and the quality of the headphones was even on max volume hard to understand. The worst part was the toilet with the feeling of being in a bad central station toilet. LA to Calgary. Seating is cramped and no leg room for a 3 hour flight. In Calgary we had to claim our baggage after customs even though we were flying to Edmonton and recheck baggage. Out flight was delayed for over 35 minutes should have departed Calgary at 10.30pm didn't taxi down the runway until 11.05pm. DEL-MXP Tuesday April 24th. Delay at Delhi: more than 90 minutes without any information or communication from the cockpit. The information main panel inside the cabin informing about the elapsed time the outside temperature etc. was out of order from the take off until the landing in MXP. The cabin crew assistance has been awful: soon after the meal service all the cabin crew without any exception disappeared. We flew from Brussels to Toronto. When boarding the plane there was an awful smell coming from the lavatory and the plane was not cleaned from the previous flight. Food was very limited and only Indian Food was available. Unprofessional service by Flight Attendants. Toilets were not cleaned at all throughout the 8 hour flight. First time flying Jet Airways and will never fly again. Our flight from CCU-BOM on 26th July 2012 was rescheduled just because there were not enough passengers on the flight we booked we had an international connecting from Mumbai so we left early and had to wait for 10 hours in Mumbai to catch our connection. Service on the flight and the service from ground staff was unprofessional. I used to travel from KWI-IDR-KWI every 6 months only because of the Jet Airways services and my perfect matching time schedule with it. My last journey with Jet Airways (May 2012) was the worst flight from Kuwait to Mumbai. The flight didn't contain seat back screens. Secondly and most disappointing was the night dinner which they served in very cheap quality meal box. I will recommend Jet Airways to my friends and family if they really provide the services they were providing previously. Tried to change to an earlier flight but that requires a $50 per person fee which makes no sense because the itinerary is identical and if there's space what difference does it make. There cost does not go up if we leave on the earlier flight. To make matters worse we were told that changing to the earlier flight would be free if our flight was showing as delayed. At the time it wasn't so he couldn't do anything. Even though we have a 4 month old baby that we now had to keep happy in the airport for 5 hours. To top it all off shortly following the earlier flights departure we learned that our flight would be delayed. My experiences with Westjet have always been nothing but positive but this inconvenience that could have been easily avoided has erased all the positive experiences. This was an unnecessary attempt by them to squeeze extra money out of me. Travelled from Kolkata to London Heathrow via Mumbai and appalled by the lack of customer service rude staff who constantly bumped into me on the aisle without apologising one of my 2 bags left in Mumbai. Overall just a very poor level of service. DEL-SXR. Travelled LHR-DEL and then connected onto Srinagar. Had 46kgs weight allowed from London to Delhi but they did not allow the same on the domestic sector. They said policy had been revised 5 months back and baggage allowance on domestic sector was only 20kgs and not a kg extra. Had to pay overweight for rest of the weight. They have recently increased the overweight charges by 100% from Rs.100 per kg to Rs.200 per kg. The airline is totally disorganised and literally extort money. If they want to keep customers they should revisit their customer service strategy. Heathrow-Mumbai-Hyderabad. Web check-in was easy. Onboard the seats were torn. Inflight entertainment pretty good but no great choice of Indian regional movies. No hot towels no welcome drink and food was served at midnight 2.5hrs after we boarded the flight. Cabin crew seemed very bored and frustrated with their job. The food was neither tasty nor sufficient for an adult. On the other side the domestic service was far better perfect evening snack cheerful cabin crew. I enjoyed the 1hr flight better the 9.5hr international flight. This would be my last international flight on Jet. Bangkok to Heathrow and would not recommend them. The dirtiest toilets I've ever seen on any plane and staff couldn't care less about cleaning them. Appalling inedible food poor service and cabin crew that were not particularly polite. Leg room was quite good and the seats comfortable. The inflight entertainment was also good. Unfortunately the rest of the flight was so bad even comfortable seats and good entertainment couldn't make up for it. Flew from Toronto to Barbados. For the price I paid I expected a complimentary meal on a 6 hour flight. Onboard entertainment was pointless as it was only on for 20% of the flight and the flight attendants are in serious need of some hospitality training - some of the rudest ones I've encountered in my 20 years of travelling. Will definitely not be flying with Westjet again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone else either. Chandigarh to Bangalore. Was disappointed. Flight delayed more than an hour and they didn't even apologize for the delay. They gave us the seat in the last row (where we couldn't recline the seat) in spite of empty seats in front. Inflight service was poor and getting a glass of water was difficult. Overall my experience from JFK to Chennai and connecting to Hyderabad is poor. Staff service is poor seat comfort average. Very poor inflight entertainment often with interruptions. Check-in in Chennai is very poor no systematic way of checking and very unprofessional staff. YYZ-BRU return. Both ways the flight left on time and arrived early. The meal provided both ways was excellent however the service was a little impersonal and cold. When we arrived back in Toronto the plane had just left the active runway and most people were up trying to get their carry on bags while the flight attendants were still in there seats. It took a good 2 or 3 minutes before anyone asked for passengers to please sit down. No one listened anyway. EWR-BOM-EWR in economy class. I had checked in online for BOM-EWR however on arrival had to queue for 15 mins. Although class-wise and seat-wise boarding is 'supposedly' followed they just forget the last cluster of seats. You have to be smart enough to stand along with the previously announced seats in order to avail some cabin luggage space. Cabin crew disinterested requested help in stowing my bag to a male crew member and he simply ignored my request. Food service was very slow and late. Even beverages were a rarity and had to repeatedly ask the crew for it. The last snack on both the forward and return journey was a total disappointment! From EWR-BOM I was smart enough to carry some snacks onboard anticipating the conditions. Inflight entertainment is the only saving grace with a decent collection of music/movies. But no way does it justify the ticket prices that are competitive with other International Carriers. Mumbai-London. I had the misfortune of sitting directly behind a couple who's two babies screamed incessantly for the vast majority of the flight. The cabin crew showed about as much interest in shutting them up as the parents did. As a result a long flight made seemingly longer due to the constant racket and lack of sleep. I flew business on the way out and the attitude of the cabin crew was pretty lax. Once they'd handed the food out they were not to be seen again until breakfast was served. The return leg in which I flew economy wasn't much better in terms of the attitude of the cabin crew. The only way I've been able to guarantee a non-veg meal is to request it when booking-in online. All in all not too happy with them. LAX to YVR. I travel this route regularly and have witnessed Westjet's standards and service decline. This flight was 2 hours late leaving LAX. No warning provided by ground staff at LAX. No apology or explanation by pilot once onboard. IFC bored. Aircraft dirty Westjet still continue to refer to passengers as 'guests' yet increasingly do not treat them as such. Air Canada product now is consistently superior. Having a flight completely cancelled one weekend due to mechanical problems with the plane and then the following weekend having the flight delayed because of mechanical problems that necessitated switching out not only the original plane scheduled but also the replacement aircraft after one leg of the journey severely reduced my confidence in the Westjet fleet. Service agents have also suffered a noticeable decline in the quality of service and attitude with which they deal with the passengers. All told - there are other airlines out there and I will be using them where possible. Very bad experience! Flying London to Bangalore via Mumbai return via Delhi. Travelling with 10 month old no consideration from crew. Worst customer service delayed connecting flights long waiting times (45 min after arrival stuck onboard before being allowed to leave - 30 mins before stroller was handed back and another 45 mins before luggage arrived). Staff attitude was unfriendly unhelpful and inefficient. Flight from Vancouver to Calgary delayed a few times within a few hours due to mechanical problems. I was stranded in Vancouver for more than 6 hours before WestJet arranged an alternative plane to fly to Calgary. My original 4 pm departure from Vancouver turned out to be 10.33 pm arriving in Calgary a few minutes to 1 am. Very disappointed even though they gave us $10 food voucher. Delhi-London. Inflight service was appalling. Cabin crew was extremely rude and unprofessional. The food was of very poor quality. I had one beer before meal when I asked for another drink I was told that since I have already had one drink I have to wait at least 2 hours before I could have another. LHR-BOM-LHR. Have to say that this airline has completely lost its charm. Only one drinks service through the entire 9/9.5 hour flight. Meals were completely tasteless. The only positive was the generous luggage allowance which is 46kg. Definitely sticking to the Middle Eastern airlines for trips to India in the future such as Emirates. Toronto to Brussels Brussels to Delhi and back to Brussels. The food quality which was excellent before had declined considerably. The coffee is brewed badly and the stewardess service has dropped significantly. Just arrived from Delhi and me and several other passengers using the wheelchair had to wait for an hour for the Jet Airways staff to retrieve our luggage and no one would help us. I used to be a loyal customer but will not choose Jet Airways again. Flight from Palm Springs to Vancouver in what is apparently a new plane without any entertainment units installed and no food for sale? What on earth has happened to Westjet. I used to like flying with them now they are more like Skyservice (which is definitely not a compliment). DOH-BOM-DOH Business Class. Standards have fallen! Cabin looked worn and tired. Old fashioned domestic type business class seats on the B738. Food so-so. Cabin crew attentive but amateurish. Wines served in business class were cheap French 4€ table wines. Champagne AWOL. IFE was terrible. Worst part was the time it took for luggage to arrive both in BOM and DOH. Bags were tagged priority but arrived next to last. Have flown Westjet for the first time between YYZ and YYC. I'm highly disappointed! Those seats are not comfortable. The inflight entertainment system is ridiculous. The so called ''live TV'' when the crew makes an announcement doesn't even stop. With other airlines at least it stops so you can continue watching where you were. Plus I find the crew and the employee in general so unprofessional. This over friendly attitude just look too fake to me! My family and I travelled Doha to Cochin return Business class both ways. Outbound flight to Cochin a youngster from economy was permitted to stow his baggage over my wife's seat came into business class opened the locker dropping a bag on my wife sitting below. This happened in the presence of inflight staff who did not intervene and stop this passenger. On our return journey we boarded before economy passengers had occupied their seats we had many passengers 'brushing' past us in the aisle with bulky hand baggage. The finale to this memorable saga on the return flight we were presented with the standard Menu card. We were seated in the second row from the front of business class and yet we were told that the fish on the menu had already run out. I will not be travelling Jet in the future. HKG to London via Mumbai. Landed Mumbai but Boeing 777 to London delayed. Initially told delay 30 mins then it was going to be 7 hours late. We were offered food urn of sweetened tea and some kind of veggie burger. On our flight suddenly every reading light came on and the crew couldn't turn them off. The entertainment system didn't work for my seat for most of the flight. Reassuringly everything started working 4 hours into our flight. Not a pleasant experience cabin crew helpful and pleasant. BOM-BLR return. I booked with Jet Airways in order to gain some miles with United. Boarding at BOM began 45 minutes before the flight and everyone was seated (at 100% load) 15 minutes later. We sat at the gate another 30 minutes hooked to the jet bridge. The aircraft held 8 in F and 162 in the back on a 737-800 and I have never seen such tight seat pitch. Boarding is done in a single group thus people are scattered up and down the aisle trying to stow carry on baggage. It's a zoo with folks lining back up the jet bridge. Cabin crew was still trying to secure the cabin for landing 30 seconds before landing. Plenty of cabin advertising. As it is it appears to be the Indian version of a low cost Irish carrier. Goa-Mumbai-Vadodara Domestic Flight. The food on both flights was below average and service in general poor. Flight was on time and baggage wait acceptable. Needs a lot of improvement to become an international carrier. It does not make sense to pay a full fare against the low cost domestic carriers. YWG-YVR return. Check-in slow have to drop your bags on the belt. Flight was fairly full poor boarding once on board FA's did their job that's about it. Selection of IFE was ok have to purchase movies AC is free. Buy on board food was avg. Arrived on time bags were fairly quick. The return a week later delayed an hour out of YVR no explanation or apology. Similar service not great FA's were downright rude chatting in the back. One water run was made throughout the whole flight. Bags arrived quick. Only reason I took WestJet was because the AC flight was sold out that day. YHZ-YYZ-YHZ. Staff haggard looking and unprofessional with their constant chit chat about their personal lives. Flights late both ways and entertainment not started until well into flight. Poor selection of buy onboard snacks. Planes starting to show wear and tear. Late again the last 6 consecutive flights with West Jet have not worked flights between Edmonton and Comox or Edmonton and Abbostford are always late sitting here right now waiting for flight no. 184 in Abbostford going to be one and one half hours late. Always consistent. Very old planes no comfort and meals are expensive. No reading lights my table was broken. It's low-budget but doesn't worth it. GIG-POA. Service on flight was fine seat space good but as their flights seem to consist of multi-stop flights down the Atlantic when the flight was delayed at the beginning it accumulated into a 2.5 hour delay and as Infraero provides the staff for check-in the only WebJet employees disembarked on the plane just to check us in. We spent an hour and a half just with the flight displayed as \"delayed\" then the flight arrived 30 minutes later than it had delayed. The embittered passengers did form a sort of camraderie and the airline staff were profusely apologetic (although as noted they do not offer alcoholic beverages with which to reward us). The price was almost half of TAM or Gol (one-way was around R$100/US$60) and the planes themselves were well kept and quite comfortable. Don't know if this was just a bad day or not its just a very small low-budget carrier. This airline is for day trips and short hops. I would not recommend it for connections with other flights or any place where you expect to carry more than one bag. It is cheap compared to Alitalia (which can be shocking in price sometimes for some rather short flights.) For the price the service was as expected and I'd fly them again but I would not recommend them to finicky fliers strictly a no frills operation. Turin to Catania and back operated by A320. I am satisfied by this airline you can save a lot of money obviously you have to renounce the on board service; however the flight assistant are kind and smiling. The pitch of seats is acceptable. To conclude Windjet is basic but very professional and confortable airline. I have heard of their demise today a great disappointment. My first experience with them was arriving with my wife at STN last year to hear of the last minute cancellation of our IAD flight due to supposed mechanical failure (underbooking more likely). We were immediately flown out to NYC on Virgin Upper Class from LHR after an M25 dash and transferred to Washington on the next day following a dreadful overnight stop near JFK. Our return flight from IAD was excellent in every respect. Having taken up our initial experience with their PA department on our return I heard from them three weeks later - with an offer of two free return flights to anywhere on their network. We took this up in June for a California flydrive via LAS. Outward flight was again excellent in every respect and Stansted was a revelation - but Maxjet let themselves down with a 3 hour delay at LAS on the way back because of a glitch over catering equipment that left them with the need to wash and sterilise the set used on the outward flight. Once we were in the air it was the usual good standard. Had they not gone under we would almost certainly have flown with them again. STN-LAS-STN. Overall a very pleasant experience. STN check-in is quick and the Fast-track through security a bonus. The lounge at the boarding gate is a little small. Aside from that it offers all the standard biz-class trimmings. On time departures in both directions we also well received. The 767 cabin is bright and spacious. The website 'tour' of it doesn't do it justice. The seats are very comfortable enabling a comfortable nap but they do not recline to horizontal. On board service is good and the food quality fine although the menu could have a little more variety. This is a better product than the various premium economy services available and I would use them again. Returned from Las Vegas and found the experience a revelation compared to economy class. The leg room is very good (60\" seat pitch) with nearly flat seats (160 degrees). The lounge at Stansted was very good and would have been appreciated at Las Vegas where there is not a lounge. Food much better quality than economy. Service on the return flight a little slow due to training of new personnel but not bad enough to ruin the experience. Overall very good value for what you pay and I would not hesitate to recommend this airline to anyone as a superior and cost efficient alternative to economy or prem/economy with major airlines. JFK to STN. The good - easy and efficient check-in (check in opens at JFK at 4:00 PM for 8:15 PM flight); Good lounge shared with other airlines - good food and amenities and beverages; Good escort through \"fast track\" security - basically you go to head of reguar security line; Good seats - a little dated but quite comfortable with perhaps 80% recline; Good but not great food served tray style - not like mainstream business airlines. Skip the greasy 3 cheese omelet for breakfast Fruit plate is a better choice.The \"not quite up to business class\": Crew do not work as a team and appear not to have worked together before; Plane is a little dated (we got the one that had been with some Asian airline given the signs in Chinese characters as well as English) We were kept informed of delay updates (see below) but helpful staff coordinator suffered from lack of information from others. The bad: Captain did not show up but either the original one or another was flown in from Charlotte NC while we waited -- 8:15 PM takeoff became 11:45 takeoff. Would I fly MaxJet again? Yes at the $521 (including taxes) one way fare The key is what others have posted: If you are used to mainstream airline business class you will be disappointed but if economy or premium economy is your experience you will be impressed. Las Vegas to Stansted Be warned there is no Maxjet lounge at Vegas - and no lounge-sharing arrangement. I was forced to purchase a day-pass to the United lounge. Maxjet have let themselves down very badly in that respect. One of their managers at Vegas told me in response to my complaint that they have been trying for over a year to get some space! Otherwise the trip was satisfactory. I've used them several times before for the STN-JFK-STN route but they always let themselves down with the catering - certainly not the \"gourmet\" meals that they claim. But overall as on my previous trips with them Maxjet are extremely good value for money. Return STN-JFK. Until this trip always flown economy class. The experience of not having my knees under my chin came as quite a revelation as did not having to pay £3 for an inflight sandwich. STN to JFK was excellent: fast track security then free drinks and food in the Maxjet lounge. On the plane the cabin crew were attentive and efficient plane left on time food was nice and we arrived 20 minutes early. The return night flight from JFK was not so good: the plane left 2 hours late and the cabin service was amateurish and haphazard. But who's complaining? STN-JFK yesterday was a pleasant enough flight. Aircraft a little old but clean (apart from WCs) and very spacious cabin with excellent seats. Food and beverages good as too was entertainment system. The let down the crew. Hopelessly disorganised and unprofessional. Laughing and smiling behind the galley curtains - short sharp and inappropriate in front of the customer. Most well dressed but a couple of the guys very scruffy. Two of the female crew excellent and great ambassadors. I was due to fly from Stansted to Washington and the flight never got off the ground after them keeping us in the lounge for 5 hours. The ground crew were polite and worked hard to help us but it was clear they were struggling. We were all shipped off to LHR for a Virgin flight (the only partner they have for transfers it would appear) the next morning. They organised taxis hotel and dinner as well as tickets for VS next morning. When I arrived at Virgin next morning they did not have our tickets just as well I left plenty of time. They got some people into Upper some into Premium Economy and the rest (me included) were offered Economy and \"2 free return tickets on MaxJet as compensation\" - I figured this would let my long suffering wife have a moment of luxury and selected this as they had also run out of Upper tickets ! I have now been chasing these elusive tickets for some 2.5 months 3 emails 5 calls constant promises but no action or return call. Shortly I will lose patience and visit the airport to confront them. The return flight was 5 hours late due to \"a technical fault on the place\" and they had to move the NY flight out to pick us up. They appear to have no spare capacity at all and a number of old worn 767 units. Other aspects of the flight food was okay service polite seat excellent I would use it if it was reliable but judging from comments in the lounge from other travellers it might not appear so. Add to that the crummy post sales service handling a problem and I cannot recommend them if you need the route for business. Allow for error it would seem likely based on evidence. Sad good idea polite people on the ground under funded poor service record. I only hope that if they do go out of business that this does not stop other people executing this idea more effectively. I have to say how terribly disappointed we all are having had to cancel our vacation to the USA for next year. We live in London very near to Stansted and were excited about travelling from there rather than Gatwick. Our plans involved Washington DC. We booked our seats early May. I specifically asked about the Washington flight and I have an e-mail guarantee this would not be suspended again. Lies. Suddenly by e-mail not even personally addressed to me I receive notification that our flights home have been cancelled. Offered the alternative of JFK. However we had plans to fly on from Vegas which was our first stop over to Florida and then fly up to Washington for a weekend visit. Our internal flight and hotel was booked on a non-refund basis. So we have lost money big time because of Maxjet Airways. I asked Maxjet for compensation regarding this but all they would offer was $100 per person and then we needed to get to JFK instead. Result = cancellation of flight from Florida to IAD lost £550 ($1000+) - cancellation of Washington weekend hotel & trips £600 ($1200+). We would then need to book a Jet Blue flight from Florida into JFK currently costing $319 per person (total £850 or $1941). Sadly we could not afford all this with just $600 compensation from Maxjet - so our plans are over finished. Maxjet took ages to refund our original ticket price. Reliability and honesty is the key for success. Judgement is out on Maxjet as far as I am concerned. Back to Virgin Atlantic from now on. First time using MaxJet. Very good service and meal going to Washington (Dulles) staff very friendly and helpful. Return flight delayed 1.5 hours so meal not served till late at night. Would consider using again - shame they dont fly to Atlanta which is where I was travelling onto. I believe the flight I came back on was the last one to Washington. LAX-STN return7. The flight to STN was 75% full and there was plenty of room. The plane appeared tired and old and in need of a good cleaning. The crew was pleasant but so disorganized it was almost comical to watch. They appeared to need a good training class! The food was average. As previously noted it is very difficult to get in or out of your seat if you have a window seat and the person in front has the seat all the way down. The lounge in LAX was a little inconvenient but very spacious and comfortable. Check in was very easy with no lines! The return flight was on a newer plane and the crew was 100% better in their organization. This flight was about 80% full. Stansted lounge was convenient and well stocked. We would definitely fly Maxjet again because we loved the extra space semi-flat seats and the price was right. The fear of cancellation is the only major obstacle so we will always add time on both ends of our trip. We would rate them 3 stars outgoing and 4 stars on the return. Very Annoyed. Maxjet cancelled our flights (via e-mail) on Oct. 9 and they also cancelled the entire route (Stansted to Dulles) so that we couldn't rebook. They suggested an itinerary that would involve a 4.5 hour layover in JFK and a midnight arrival in DC. We're travelling with a 10 month old infant so this was impossible to contemplate on top of a long journey already. I wrote to \"customer care\" at Maxjet about this on Oct. 10 and also complained about the late notice. Our travel is less than a month from the cancellation date so now we have to scramble for flights and reasonable fares - not easy. Have I heard from Maxjet - despite several repeated requests for \"customer care\"? NO. Nothing. I'm really just disgusted. I don't think I'll ever hear from them. Very very poor service. STN-LAX return. Outbound excellent with smooth checkin fast track security at Stansted and through to lounge. Very good lounge with great food and drinks. Flight left on time as plane was half full. Crew ok friendly enough but definitely not polished like BA. Way back was painful. Our reserved seats were given to a separate passenger but after my partner had a strop they were given back. Lounge at LAX is pretty awful. Flight left on time but it took 2 hours for dinner to arrive. Digiboxes are a pain. Not sure Maxjet will survive as the plane outbound was 50% full and the flight the day before was cancelled which occurs regularly. Still a better product than BA or Virgin premium class as its a lot cheaper and fantastic legroom. Could be a great product if they get it together and advertise their concept. STN-LAS-STN. From fast track at Stansted to excellent leg room and attentive flight crew I can't fault the service. I thoroughly enjoyed the flight (my criticism being the noisy aircraft). Okay it may not be proper business class in the eyes of some but you get what you pay for in this world. Flew Maxjet to Los Angeles and back from Las Vegas have to say the experience was disappointing feel MaxJet jet offers economy class service with old fashioned business class seats. The cabin crew were the worst I have experienced. The digiplayer means you cannot use your tray for meals or work and watch the TV. No pre take -off drink first proper drink offered one hour after take-off meal took forever which on a night flight to wait two hours for the meal to be served is stupid we took off at 19.30 by 22.00 we were still only being offered the dessert. Breakfast was the same slow service and slow to take away the trays which made many of the passengers impatient. Shame as the quality of the food is very good. The basic problem is lack of interest by the cabin crew who seem to respond to people asking for what they want rather that actually knowing what people want. The cabin steward serving our side of the plane went down the isle serving one drink at a time - I had a glass of red my wife had glass of white he went to the front came back with my wife's white wine went back and came back with my red! Why no drinks trolley? If you wanted another glass it was not offered it had to be asked for. Washington to London Stansted. Excellent check in then directed to Northwest lounge in terminal B which was packed out and only offered limited snacks and drinks. After the scheduled departure time had passed I requested an update from the rather miserable Northwest lounge agent who then told me that the flight was 1.5 hours late. So much for keeping your passengers informed. The flight finally boarded nearly 2 hours behind schedule. The aircraft a Boeing 767-200 is fitted out in a 2x2x2 business class configuration but was only about 50% full. The seats are of the old fashioned business class style so not lie flat but plenty of leg room. We departed for the active runway only to park up with the engines shut down due to adverse weather. So there we stayed parked up at the end of the runway for over 2 hours. The crew did what they could to keep us happy. We were served soft drinks and fizzy wine and were allowed to use our mobile phones. Eventually the aircraft was allowed to take off with a new flight plan whch avoided the bad weather. By that stage I decided to sleep for the rest of the flight and managed 5 hours kip with a reasonable degree of comfort. In the morning I enjoyed a light breakfast with tea prior to landing some 4 hours behind schedule. Maxjet offer a very good and well priced business class product but their timekeeping is questionable. STN-LAS return. Outbound prompt. Return flight delayed an hour by minor mechanical defect but kept advised by crew. Planes are tired and seats old but they are very comfortable and crew generally try very hard. May not be up to true business class but close and at the price you cannot complain. Only problem with LAS is Virgin Atlantic out of LGW. Depending on slots and delays (appear endemic on VA) Maxjet can arrive just behind a 747 full of passengers so immigration can be a nightmare. First time in many visits to US I've found immigration agent with personality and at pains to apologise for the delays due to VA! Similarly on return if the VA flight is delayed the LAS terminal 2 can become very crowded in the absence of separate lounge facility for Maxjet. Would be delighted to fly Maxjet again. See they have finally acknowledged defeat and cancelled their IAD service from next month. STN-LAS and back and have in the past used Maxjet to/from JFK. Delays on both outward (ex STN) flights of 5 and 2 hours respectively but both returns on time. Aircraft old but acceptable seats OK (typical 80's business class) and food only average (not gourmet). Beware pre-assigned seats can disappear for no apparent reason so it is still worth checking in early - our pre-booked seats were not booked when we checked in (despite being assigned when we checked a few days earlier) and handling agent unable to explain why. Tip - try and sit near the front the service often deteriorates the further you sit from the forward galley. Attitude of Manager at STN to seat problem very poor - big false smile on her face whilst she said \"seats are not guaranteed we have six aircraft which often change\". All the aircraft are 767's and even if configured slightly differently they all have a row 3! My biggest gripe is service on board. Whilst cabin crew in are friendly/polite they take an age to serve drinks each meal course clear up replenish drinks etc. On night flight LAS-STN last Thursday it was 4 hours after take off we got our last course and then waited an age for coffee - not good if you wanted to sleep second half. Unbelievably on a full flight there was just 1 cart serving the cheese/dessert and the coffees making very very slow progress down the aircraft from the front. I was in row 15 - so was getting very impatient. Other airlines run their meal service like a military operation and replenish empty wine glasses along the way routinely and often Maxjet crew faff about and make painfully slow progress. Then whilst this is going on you'll see many of the crew chatting in the front galley maybe clearing up but why not clear up on the second half of the flight when everyone has finished eating and will be asleep - giving the crew plenty of time to do what they want? And don't rely on the crew call button - I saw numerous attempts to attract crew's attention and on hearing the call button \"ping\" often the attendant(s) did not even look up yet alone look down the cabin to see who was calling. I tried six times to call them while I sat with an empty wine glass before someone bothered to respond. As I said - the crew are friendly and do try but they clearly need better training. It is not a \"number of crew to passenger\" ratio (though it is poor) because they are often standing chatting in the galley. People want a quicker meal service especially on night flights when they want to sleep later - and there is no reason why you should not have the opportunity to enjoy the full three courses plus a nightcap. MAXjet crew just need to focus and get organised with the meal service and get it done quicker - then pay attention to drinks replenishment. Overall comfortable seats reasonable entertainment (though the content of the digebox a bit dated) reasonable food quality (when you get it) but enjoyment of meal really spoiled by one hour wait (with empty glass) between courses. If you are used to flying economy or premium economy you may enjoy MAXjet but if you usually fly regular business class don't expect anything like the service or attention to detail you have become used to. That said - MAXjet is often much cheaper so it is up to you just know what to expect. Our second trip on Maxjet this year: this time going to Washington. Again I have no complaints. We had no delays on our outward journey and only an hour coming back and this was spent in the lounge so no real hardship. My wife has flown Maxjet a number of times and raved about onboard comfort and service. So I decided this time to fly with her IAD-STN instead of on United as I usually do. I had the opportunity to experience the main problem with Maxjet - our flight was cancelled on the day of departure. My wife was travelling on a free ticket from a previous flight which had been cancelled. Perhaps Maxjet's motto should be \"A superb experience - if you get off the ground\". It seems that cancellations are all too frequent on the IAD-STN route and always blamed on a \"maintenance problem\". I suspect however the real problem is lack of bookings. We were readily re-booked on Virgin Upper Class - a truly awful experience. My wife said the Maxjet service food drink and comfort were far above Virgin. Maxjet assured us we would have free ground transportation IAD-STN. I mentioned this at Virgin check-in at the Virgin Lounge and twice to the flight attendant and was assured that everything was ok. When I checked at the Virgin limo counter at LHR they had never heard of us and upon checking said we weren't entitled to transportation. Virgin could care less about solving our problem. I called the Maxjet UK number and apparently got a rep at the New York call center. She told me to go outside and get a Checker cab and tell the driver it was for Maxjet. I told her I was in London and had never seen a Checker cab there in the last 40 years! She didn't understand and disconnected me. We ended up renting a car at LHR instead of STN even though our destination was only 20 minutes from STN. Maxjet has great on-board service at a very good price - if you ever get a chance to experience it. Just flew roundtrip STN to LAX for first time on MAXjet. As has been posted previously if you're a business class passenger looking for a deal forget it. If you're economy looking for a deal it's not bad. STN lounge is fine LAX lounge is a joke (being bused out from an airline gate to a business lounge made of prefabricatd buildings is so silly). The planes are old I checked my return plane's FAA details and found it was registered as built in 1985. The seats are the old fashioned mechanical ones toilets I experienced were not really clean cabin noise is surprisingly high and the overall impression is not so good. The service was OK they try hard but food no way \"gourmet\" it's what you'd expect from airline food. MAXjet is a great concept I support it but they need to do it on a less than creaky budget basis. LAX - STN and impressed with the service. Although the seats are old style they are not uncomfortable. Food better than Virgin and cabin crew were pleasant. I will use them again. Stansted to Dulles. Stansted lounge as good as others reported fast track etc. Only defect was 2 of the toilets were out of order but as the plane was half-full that wasn't a great handicap. All on time. Recommended Maxjet to several folk in Virginia especially musicians travelling to the Charlottesville Music Festival from Europe. But warned them of possible unreliability. Returning on 24th from Dulles - flight cancelled but an excellent and friendly check-in steward made sure we were on the Upper Class Virgin flight at 6.30 and arranged for transport to meet us at Heathrow and take us to Stansted. Virgin lounge even more luxurious and sampled the flat-bed system on way home. Our cab driver said he often did this run for Maxjet and another re-routed traveller had had both flights cancelled and re-scheduled. It sounded as if there had been more recent difficulties over parts/maintenance especially on the Dulles flight. Would certainly fly Maxjet again hoping for the best and keeping fingers crossed. STN to LAS. Check-in a little slow but friendly fast-track through security and then into the lounge which was very busy due to the delayed LAX flight (although lounge being expanded). Service was very good as was food and general view is that this is great value for money. The planes are not that new but they seem well maintained and comfortable. My only gripe was that there were at least 3 passengers with young children and solo travellers such as myself all got asked to move around the aircraft to accomodate these passengers to have \"nicer seats\". I am usually happy to do this but one wonders why these people could not have got seats all arranged well in advance (particularly as the flight was not full). It did seem as if the staff were a little too eager to please but just a small moan. Overall a great product at a superb price. It looks like the LAS flights are more likely to be on time than others particularly the JFK flights STN-LAS-STN. Outbound flight excellent. Good cabin crew and food was best we have had on an airline. Return flight delayed due to a member of staff calling in sick - a replacement had to be flown in from Los Angeles. Made me wonder what would have happened if the Los Angeles flight was not on the new roster! Flight home was also good. My concern with is the attitude to safety. I am used to British airlines who have a very strict policy with regards to safety but Maxjet did not ask passengers to be seated when the captain illuminated the seat belt sign. They also allowed an obviously inebriated passenger to sit in the exit seat which should not have been allowed. Stansted to Las Vegas return. Outgoing flight fast tracked through security. Seats comfortable and inflight entertainment good cabin staff excellent food more than edible. Return flight on time same service as before but captain made up 45 mins so landed early. All in all you get what you pay for and at prices at £600 return they are cracking value for money yes the seats and planes are a little tired but give them a chance. Cant see how anyone could complain about the Cabin crew. Dulles to Stansted return. We booked our tickets well in advance and paid $1000 each for the roundtrip flight. Check in at Dulles fine. They give you a ticket to go through the priority security screening which is nice. Maxjet uses the Northwest Lounge along with a couple other airlines so the lounge can get crowded. The lounge had the typical selection of drinks and snacks available. On entering the plane I thought the interior had seen better days. The flight was about half full so everyone was able to spread out. The seat was comfortable and a lot of space. I wish they had given a short brief on how to use the seat because I didn't know the leg rest could extend back and forth to fit the legs until the return flight (it's the big black lever in the armrest). My nine year old daughter was able to figure it out and she slept the entire flight. They handed out the digi players shortly after takeoff and started a meal service. I can't comment too much on the outbound service because I tried to sleep. The return leg from Stansted is where Maxjet shines. The check in was quick and fast track through security is great. We made it through security in about three minutes. Maxjet lounge in Stansted outstanding - wide selection of snacks/food as well as drinks. The service on the return flight was fine but it didn't seem as friendly as the first flight. The food was good but it was definitely airline food I think Maxjet is a little liberal using gourmet to describe the food selection. Maxjet is a great value for the money. The seats space lounge and priority security are well worth the price. It looks like they are upgrading the lavs. The interior of the planes are nice with new carpet and the seats are good condition. I look forward to flying Maxjet again in a couple of years. Flew the inaugural flight STN-LAX. Considering we had press and the Maxjet Customer Service Director onboard service wasn't outstanding. The staff spent most of the trip in the rear galley chatting passed through the cabin 5 times (on an 11.5 hour flight) with water and juice for everything else you had to use the call bell. On one occasion a member of staff stood for 10 minutes chatting in the galley and passengers had to get up to get a glass of water rather than be served. The digeplayers had out of date content - last updated March 2007 and I managed to get through 5 sets due to battery life dying - fine as they had spares available as flight was about a quarter full not so great if no spares available! I asked the Purser if I could have the email address of the CEO who welcomed us on board and invited us to give some comments (he asked us to contact him personally with any comments) to be given a dressing down and then told to visit maxjet.com. Clearly she wasn't interested in any customer feedback. Really rather disappointing think I'll stick to UA next time. STN-JFK return. Travelling with infant. Excellent service by cabin crew however the airline does not cater for young children. Our daughter did not need a bassinet but we noticed that there was no provision to hang a bassinet. Travelling from STN is good with the fast track lane for security however at JFK no adequate provisions for business passengers at security. The 767s are fairly old. Stansted to Washington faultless however the plane had seen better years. The return flight was good with plenty of space - plane being condition however the service on occasions did represent elements of 'Faulty Towers' with a companion being bathed in champagne. Both myself and my wife had two different menus which did not represent the actual menu being offered during the flight. Attention to detail would have made all the difference. However excellent amount of personal space. Based on round trip comparison costs the trip represented good value. Return Stansted to Los Angeles. Check in at Stansted easy and Fast Track Security. Maxjet Lounge was nothing special and offered the normal fayre you expect. It is a shame it does not have its own washrooms. They started flying the route the day before and I was disappointed with the service offered. One was left to wonder how the crew would have coped had the flight been full rather than just under half as it was. The return to Stansted was a delight - crew were eager to help and made the flight a pleasure. The seats were comfortable but controls took a bit of getting used to. IFE is provided by personal units. As others have said there is an issue over battery life and mine \"died\" on me on the way back. I would rate them 3 stars for the outbound and 5 stars for the return for value for money. I recently traveled from Washington DC to Stansted with MaxJet. The flight over was not bad but I thought their gourmet meals were overrated. The trip back was a nightmare. My flight was cancelled and I was flown to JFK instead. I wouldn't have minded this if they had actually gotten me to Washington in time to catch my connecting flight. There was ample time given that the JFK flight was several hours earlier than the original flight. Instead I was given the run-around on the phone pre-flight at Stansted and at JFK as to how I was getting home. At JFK a rep from MaxJet assured us (I had found others who were in the same predicament) that we would be flown on Jet Blue to Washington. Everyone but me was. They couldn't find my name on some list even though I provided them with my confirmation number etc. Long story short I got home a day late having missed appointments and obligations. I have written to MaxJet and have not even had the courtesy of a reply. Please be prepared for any eventuality if you fly this airline. My husband and I flew from Washington Dulles to London and back in June. The 767 was broken and they substituted an Air Florida 737 with movable ottomans (possible projectiles) and the threat of a fuel stop in Gander. They crew was baffled. They didn't know how to work with the Air Florida crew. MaxJet knew the quality of the service was so far below what was advertised that they offered $500 per person rebated via coupon for future service. Three months later with multiple customer service contacts: not a dime. The return flight was on a 757 owned by the Dallas Mavericks. It was very luxurious and the Team Jet crew worked smoothly with the MaxJet crew. Bottom line: nice people working on a shoe-string with very uneven service. If an offer of reimbursement for under-performance is tendered don't hold your breath. If the plane is broken: you're out of luck. Stansted to Washington last Summer and a positive review. This year we booked Stansted to Las Vegas - what a drop in customer service in a year. Stansted lounge had a smaller range of food and drinks and was packed when we arrived. The crew onboard the outbound flight seemed to think that they were doing you a favour by serving you - the word condescending springs to mind. There were only 2 services this year - fewer than last year. You are expected to serve yourself if you want any snacks. Last year they brought them round to you every 15 minutes. On our return there is no lounge in McCarran airport and no drinks or food vouchers supplied. Again the crew were condescending in their service. I was told off by the purser as my table was at an angle and not directly in front of me. As it wasn't blocking the aisle I didn't see a problem. As others have mentioned the planes are old and it's a nuisance that the DVD player has to move when food is served. The service has gone way downhill in a year although the plane was full. I'd just returned from an economy flight with KLM to China and the service onboard KLM was better than that supplied by Maxjet. The only thing in it's favour is the extra seat width and length. Last year I was keen to book again. This year I'm not so sure. I tried it twice first time disaster second time excellent. It appears the Vegas flight is the winner - if you're going to Washington DC you are in trouble. I wanted to go with Maxjet again this summer but the thought of delays hesitation in giving us the true picture etc made me decide to cash in my Virgin airiles and leave from Heathrow which isn't what I wanted in the first place. I want to leave from Stansted. Maxjet needs to put their house in order; get their pricing right. Until then I search for options. Booked return flight -STN-JFK : outward flight faultless. Got to JFK for our return flight and told that the return flight had been cancelled due to technical problems. The customer services said we had been booked premium economy seats with Virgin to Heathrow at roughly the same time and a taxi would meet us to take us over to STN to pick our car up. We were then transferred to a different terminal to catch the Virgin flight and told that Maxjet had only authorised economy seats for us - as opposed to their promise of premium economy. Maxjet staff basically said anything you wanted to hear in order to move you on quickly! We have since been offered compensation of a round trip back to NY which has so far not materialized but looking at some of the comments from previous people regarding the age of the planes I think we would need to think twice before using again & would not recommend. 6th July flight to Washington cancelled. We had no warning and no e-mail to warn us but we checked the flight in the morning and after a lenghty phone call to Maxjet was put on a flight from Heathrow with Virgin economy class. No reason given for cancellation and promised a visit from a Rep when we got to Heathrow. We had to find the extra cost to Heathrow for a start Virgin was not expecting us but rallied round and got us on a flight a no show of course from the Maxjet Rep and so far we have not received a reply to our complaint from Maxjet. I waited as long as I could before I was forced to write this review but it seems they dont really care whether you fly with them or not! Be ready for cancellations and delays and no customer service. On a plus side we did fly back as planned from Washington(delayed) but it was a very comfortable. We had 3/4 hours restful sleep and the service on board was very good. I just dont know if i can trust them enough to use them again which is a shame as it could be such a good service. STN to JFK and flight was fine apart from a number of issues. JFK is a disaster for small airlines as the big boys get priority on departure slots. We waited two hours to be assigned a slot sat nailed to the seat unable to visit the bathroom was no fun for anyone. The endless queues in the immigration lounge also should put off any sane traveller. Other points of interest: The food was good (not exceptional) though service speed was ponderous. The tv system sits on the table and is therefore an aggravation when the food arrives due to lack of room. The choice of films/tv programmes is excellent. The planes are old and the bathrooms are in dire need of a professional upgrade - the current bathrooms have obviously had a paint job but the job was rushed and shabby. FAs are ok - some smile some dont. The seats are fine for the price but don't compare to VA or BA's business class offerings. They are vastly superior to Premium Economy seating. The plane could do with on-screen maps to show the progress of the flight and the PA system is poor. Overall - good flight good airline but still with one or two teething problems. MaxJet to Dulles flight was cancelled I received an e-mail stating this called MaxJet immediately. They re-routed us on the JFK flight and another flight within the US to get us to Dulles the same day. The only inconvenience in this is that we have to leave 3 hours earlier than planned and we have to fly on 3 airlines instead of two. We have not done this as of yet however MaxJet has been courteous and helpful on the phone. I will report back when the trip is complete. Las Vegas to Stansted. I loved the seats food and service onboard Maxjet. Service was wonderful except that they ran out of chicken dinners before we were served and had to choose the Veal. In row 3 I thought we would have been first up but ended up being served last. We chose central aisle seats and loved the freedom they provided. Huge thanks to flight attendants for great service. Stansted to LV went smoothly and our flight even arrived early. Digeplayers worked great food was fine service fine and loved the lounge at Stansted. We shared it with the New York flight and it didn't seem to be overcrowded. Free newspapers snack buffet drinks internet stations were all appreciated. Both my husband and I are in our mid 40's enjoyed our journey with MaxJet. A couple of things I would consider when we book with them again is to not book connecting flights within 24 hours of our arrival in London. We lost our connecting flights (non-refundable) and I'm waiting to see how that works out with MaxJet. The customer service rep promised refunds but I haven't heard back yet. We did purchase trip insurance but we'll see how that works out as well. We had to rebook our connecting flight at more than double the original cost to us. I also wish that Las Vegas had a lounge. If the California flights have a lounge we would probably opt to book via California. Express security is wonderful! I think MaxJet is worth flying a good product at a great price. Just be sure that you can be a bit flexible if the plane is delayed. I can't comment on the flight because I never made it. Cancelled my ticket after 5 calls to customer service to change my departure date. They could not give me a quote to change it immediately and never returned my calls after promising every time. Customer service reps on the phone were awful lacking customer care training kept me waiting forever and failed to even apologize for the situation until the 5th call. Then they wanted to charge me nearly $1000 to change my departure date. They were an absolute nightmare and I finally decided to cancel the ticket and rebook with another airline. It was cheaper to do so and I wanted to cut my losses with this company while I still could. Really Maxjet get your act together. Tried to travel to DC for business on 25th June and received an email at 09.00 before the 15.00 flight that the aircraft had been downgraded but when I phoned through to take a re-routing option through after receiving the email was told that the limited options had gone but I could have a refund or fly another day. Customer service was appalling. Beware if you are a business passenger and have meetings to attend you can NOT rely on Maxjet to get you there and the customer services could not care. Gave up on the return flight yesterday. I wish I had discovered this forum before booking with Maxjet then I might not have had such high expectations on my first business class flight to NY. We were booked on their flight to JFK on Friday 15th June (so that was probably our plane which was still on the tarmac - see previous comments). At check-in we were advised there would be a delay as a replacement plane had to be flown in from LAS as there was a problem with ours and as would seem to be the norm we were sent off to the Radisson for breakfast. After a couple more 'time changes' plus some considerable period sitting on the plane whilst supposedly waiting for a second signature on some paperwork (I'm surprised there wasn't a riot!) we eventually departed 12 hrs late. Trying to give Maxjet the benefit of the doubt - these things happen and the plane has to be safe etc. after all - I hoped they would redeem themselves on return journey. Unfortunately that wasn't to be the case. Again we encountered a 3 hr delay this time sitting on the runway whilst air traffic control found us a 'slot'. As has been said previously you do get the feeling of being fobbed-off with what seem feeble excuses but I do feel sorry for the crew who really do try their best and I have to agree that the inflight service etc. is very good. Unfortunately however this is vastly overshadowed by their unreliability. We were not offered any compensation at all but having now read other comments I can probably understand this as it would appear they'd have to compensate almost every passenger. I'm afraid I have to agree with a previous comment that if they don't get their act together pretty quickly they're not going to survive. Word seems to be spreading. I was scheduled to fly STN-LAS on Saturday 16th June. Arriving from Belfast the night before I noticed a Maxjet still on the ground. On enquiring at their desk was told it was the delayed NY and that it was to fly LAS the next morning - when leaving STN at 23.00! Simple flying maths told me that we must be 7 or 8 hours late. The desk girl said she could not say! Website said flight was on time as it still said on Saturday. Yes the flight was over 8 hours delayed - pax were put up in Radisson SAS for day and allowed £15 for meals. When the NY flight landed that evening the waiting pax cheered in the Maxjet lounge. One surprise was being told by the Captain that we were going via Iceland to refuel - the LR a/c was presumably u/s but we were never told this. Arrival in Vegas was 12.30am and then find a taxi! The stay there was enlivened by trying to find out if the flights were back on time - website page eventually taken down and call centre only - staff there knew of no problems!! Flight back was on time almost. Service was OK seats as expected and price good. Is it sensible to fly an airline with 3 tired aircraft? Maybe. Maxjet makes it hard to love them. They just canceled tomorrow's Stansted to DC flight which was sold out. They have booked us Upper Class on a Virgin flight (and offered a full refund or change of date) but we were trying to avoid the inconvenience of Heathrow as we live in Cambridge. They cancelled the one other time we tried them - when they cancelled the DC route for the whole winter! I wonder if we will be flying Maxjet back on Monday or Virgin! If they can't get their planes to be more dependable Maxjet won't survive - and shouldn't. STN-LAS-STN. We are Premium Economy upgraders rather than business travellers so our experience of high quality air travel is limited. However thanks to correspondents on this forum we thought we knew what the Maxjet experience would be like. Correct. Stansted is great Fast- Track excellent and the dedicated lounge high quality. OK the planes are a bit old but for us the outward journey was heaven: masses of legroom; attentive friendly high-calibre service; good food and entertainment; and clean toilets. In fact it was close to perfect. We have travelled to Vegas often and never arrived as sprightly and rested as this. To compare it with Virgin Premium Economy is farcical. It was superb. Unfortunately here comes the sting. After booking our flights in February (in the sale at £600 return) we monitored the flights on Maxjet's website to check reliability. Every flight (yes we should get out more). It was excellent for a couple of months but nearing our departure date things started to slip. This coincided with the reinstatement of the Washington service. We are not experts and have no knowledge of the airline business but it seems that Maxjet have barely enough planes to go round. While the Washington route was suspended things were fine now they are flying by the seat of their pants (apologies). Our return plane from Vegas arrived from London 2 hours late. We were told because of a combination of 'abnormal heat in Vegas a full load and a shorter runway because of prevailing winds' we would have to stop in JFK to refuel as we couldn't take off with a full fuel load. 38 degrees in Vegas abnormal? They've not been there often in August then. Total rubbish. We don't know what the problem was - perhaps they borrowed the plane from the Washington route (see comment below from T Williams) and it didn't have as large a fuel tank. Or perhaps it leaked?! Who knows? But it wasn't because it was hot in Vegas. We arrived at Stansted 6 hours late. I personally felt pretty ill when we had to land an hour after going to sleep and then had to sit on the tarmac for an hour. Worse than travelling Economy - possibly. We can't fault the staff (although no apology was ever given for our late arrival) and every other part of the experience was very good. We would go to Vegas again with Maxjet at sale prices as there are limited alternatives. But New York - there would appear to be better choices at similar prices. Do not rely on this airline (certainly while they try to cover too many routes with not enough planes). Just know what you are getting into. If you have two trouble free flights then you'll have a great trip and a bargain to boot. Dulles to STN on June 4 - original aircraft was in for servicing so they replaced our plane with an \"all first class\" 757 previously leased to the Dallas Mavericks basketball team. Seats were above coach but certainly far from first class. Cabin crew were very apologetic and still fed us very good food but a single aisle plane with seats that hardly recline didn't make it up for us. On the taxi trip to STN for our June 17 return we learned through the toll-free celll number that the flight would be delayed 7 1/2 hours. Phone agent would not rebook us - said we had to take care of it after arriving at the STN counter. When we got to the counter we found out the flight had been cancelled. We were put on a shuttle back to Heathrow where we were rebooked in COACH on Virgin! As consolation we were told that we would each receive two vouchers for future travel on Maxjet. We'll see if the vouchers actually show up and if the airline stays in business - otherwise I wouldn't fly these guys unless I had a whole lot of time on either side of the trip to allow for 24 hours of schedule mishaps. Also that it was interesting that of the seven flights operating this week from Dulles to Stansted 2 were delayed 7 hours 2 were delayed over 12 hours and 2 more were completely cancelled. JFK-STN-JFK last week. The plane was full on NY-London run and almost full on the return. Service remains equal if not superior to United/American Intl. business class. The experience can be described as what MaxJet calls traditional business class. This means a comfortable seat with a 60\" pitch (not a flat bed) decent food (the lobster was probably the best in flight meal I have had) alcoholic beverages served by attentive cabin crew and a decent selection of movies. There were some minor issues I would have liked to see improved such as serving dinner sooner and breakfast later and heating up the nuts before serving them (a real time inflight tracker would also be nice as would power ports) but these are minor quibbles. A note to those who would avoid MaxJet because they would rather use or accrue frequent flyer miles on a major carrier: Fly MaxJet instead. I have priced out a business class upgrade on this route on two US carriers and it was the same price before accounting for the 50000-60000 miles I would then need to expend before getting the upgrade. I prefer to save my major carrier miles for when I really need them or they are a better use of miles such as for trips to Asia. So inadequate were Maxjet's replies to my two e-mails on disrupted seating assignments that I have written to their Customer Services VP an address provided in their onboard literature. Maxjet are offering a dood fare good seat and pretty good food but let themselves down badly on reliability timekeeping and customer service. The comment on the good seat does not apply to 8D/F which they should not be selling as their regular product. My battles on changed seat assignments continued at LAS. It appears that the Reservations department do not fully understand the impact of aircraft changes some of which occur because of Maxjet's flaky reliability. The inbound aircraft was late but still had time to go out on time at 5pm. However they were always chasing the clock when the cabin crew were boarded late perhaps because of the TSA. We didn't push back until 5.15 and then had a 20min taxi. One thing that goes straight out of the window with time constraints is the canape service which I have not seen in a while. I imagine they are loaded so am I to understand that they are simply wasted? Maxjet show an overall time of 10hrs LAS-STN which I think is actually unachievable given the time factors at LAS and flight on two engines. The pilot made a bizarre departure announcement that the forecast weather for London was 54 degrees (F) and must have been reading an actual rather than a forecast. My lobster was unexpected and very good but it would have taken more than an agreeable crustacean to improve my overall impression of Maxjet on my 4th round trip. I can report a highly satisfactory outcome to my latest tranche of queries which eventualy I addressed to VPCS at Maxjet. I received comprehensive and valid responses; given the benefits offered by Maxjet in spite of their occasional failings I shall be happy to travel with them again. I just travelled with Maxjet to Las Vegas. Service was excellent for the price. The Business class cannot be compared with the likes of BA or Virgin but the price is comparable with Premium Economy. The seat is equivelent to the old style bucket seats. The seat goes back far enough to get a decent night sleep and the configuration is 2-2-2. As for the price I compared their price with Virgin and BMI's Premium economy price. And at just under £800.00 including tax it was a no brainer! I got a further discount from invegas.co.uk. The flight takes a bit longer than Virgin but this is probably due to the smaller plane. If you are a regular business class traveller and you think you are saving a fortune you will be disapointed. If however you fancy splashing out instead of economy then you will be delighted! MaxJet is an economy airline maquerading as a 'quality' alternative to BA/AA/Virgin/United business class - the Ryan Air of 'business class'. The planes are very old and tired - which means they have an unusually high percentage of mechanical problems. I was diverted to Boston enroute from Dulles to Stanstead when one of the two generators onboard (which powers the entire aircraft electrical system) failed over Newfoundland. The staff were ill prepared for any of the obvious fallout such as \"what the ---- do we do now to get to London\". I opted to take my money back from MaxJet rent a car back to DC and booked a very comfortable Virgin Economy Plus seat the following evening. I paid £999.00 each for my wife and myself to fly MAXjet from London Stanstead to Washington Dulles return. The outward flight from London was excellent. Check in VIP lounge cabin services etc were all of a high standard After a very enjoyable but tiring holiday we checked in at Dulles for our flight to Stansted only to be informed that our aircraft for the flight had been changed to a Boeing 737 and that no business class accommodation was now available. Half of the aircraft was economy class and the rest I would classify as an upgrade. We spent over an hour at the check in desk having arrived there at 19.00hrs owing to in my opinion inexperienced check in staff who were incapable of handling the situation. The security personnel sent us back to the check in desk no less than on three occasions firstly because they had not given us any boarding passes and then they had entered the wrong information or no information at all. Our problems did not end there . When we did eventually board the aircraft we remained seated for well nigh three hours before we finally took off at 0.29hrs. During this entire period we were not offered any hospitality and it was only after I had mentioned this to one of the cabin staff that cold water and a small bowl of mixed nuts were offered to the passengers and to add insult to injury the nuts were more or less immediately taken back on the grounds that take off was imminent although we still remained on the ground for another 30 odd minutes. I appreciate and understand that there was a logistical problem that was taxing some of the crew but this still does not detract from the fact that this level of service was a shamble. Where was the welcoming glass of champagne? Dinner was finally served at around 1.30am quite an unsociable hour. The seats were so restricted in their lateral movement so much so that my wife and myself both in our 70's spent a very uncomfortable night. We finally landed at Stansted at 12.30pm. Having paid £999.00 for each person I consider the offer of $500each person in vouchers to fly MAXjet valid for one year as totally inadequate. Las Vegas to Stansted. On time efficient baggage handling staff helpful and good humoured. Turbulence meant the service carts had to stay secured so dinner was individually served and the staff kept smiling. the old business-class seats are not the most comfortable for a 10 + hour flight and the movies could be a little more edgy but for that price. Stansted to JFK route twice in the last month and overall very happy with service and value. Stansted was great - fast check in fast track through security super lounge easy boarding. Service onboard was good if a little less attentive than most business class services - you had to ask for stuff instead of being constantly asked if you wanted more wine which is the norm in business class. The plane is old and cosmetically tired but what do you expect for £350. The lack of guaranteed connections and inability to check baggage onto connecting flights is worth accepting to get tickets this cheaply especially given the 30 min check in deadline. Korean Air Lounge at JFK was OK but they could do a better job of keeping the drinks stocked up. The free arrivals service at Stansted Radisson more than makes up for it. I am finding these newer airlines a breath of fresh air after years of Delta misery and look forward to seeing their network expanding further. Maxjet is keen to please and see their business expand through positive word of mouth. That is certainly happening - my only worry is that they'll use the higher load factors as an excuse to crank the prices up! LAS-STN-LAS. Seats comfortable service was good. Both flights on time fast track through security wonderful. I think Maxjet gives good value for the money will use them again - hoping they eventually having flights leaving from the Los Angeles area! STN-LAS-STN. Outbound - fast track through security worked perfectly lounge is good although crawling around the floor and lifting dusty carpet flaps for laptop power isn't really on! Flight was almost full and seemed to take ages to get everyone on board so pre flight drinks were served 30 mins into flight. Seats comfy enough although they are already showing signs of age plenty of room. Service was amateurish the crew seemed disorganized and I was trapped behind a tray table for over an hour watching the keystone cops handing out cold bread rolls. Rest of the flight was fine digiplayer was good and good selection of movies seat was great and even managed to grab a few hours sleep. Terminal 2 at LAS really is a dump! Inbound - No lounge this time and waiting for a business class flight in a bus shelter isn't on. Flight left late (again) but got a drink while we were on the ground this time as a sign of the service to come we managed to take off with several passengers still with champagne glasses on seats and in hand (a few rolled down the aisle). Service looked abysmal again (this seems to be a feature) not sure how they manage this with just 96 of us! I opted for minimal food and got out from under a tray table after just 20 mins decided to sleep for as long as possible large 80's style seats were great for a snooze resulting in 6 hrs shuteye! Toilets are grotty and worth avoiding if at all possible. Breakfast was a weird mixed grill wrap? which was luke warm managed to hang onto digiplayer until 40 mins from landing much to the annoyance of cabin crew. We landed 1 hr late no apology or even reason just late! Overall Maxjet need to change either quit pushing \"all business class\" and call it \"huge seat at a low price\" or sort out the service and cut passengers some slack to sleep or watch TV when they like! I'll fly again but I know what to expect now so a packed lunch and sleep all the way! JFK-STN-JFK. On time both ways. Seats comfortable although passengers frequently needed assistance to return seats upright. Snacks and beverages great. Food good but did not meet expectations. DigEplayers fantastic and mine was collected 30 min before landing. Bathrooms needed attention. Service very attentive. Korean Air lounge at JFK great. Stansted lounge okay. Check-in both ways a breeze. Aircraft was clean except for bathrooms. I was treated like a first class passenger. Connecting at JFK was a hassle but worth it to fly Maxjet. STN-LAS-STN. 50% outbound and 97% return full flight. Uneventful and smooth check-in both ways - disappointed that no lounge facility in Vegas. Very enjoyable outbound flight - attentive inflight service though the food quality and quantity is a big let-down. Comfortable seat for the price. Inflight entertainment via DigEplayers. Unsure why it needed to be collected 1.5 hours before landing - seem to be the policy as occurs on both directions. Surely 1/2 hour prior to is sufficient. Las Vegas to London flight on time but inflight service is less than attractive. Some cabin crews appeared to be less experienced. Food ran out rather fast on the dinner service with bread roll served cold. Being an overnight flight it would be logical to dim the cabin lights and lower the shades after dinner serving - none had been acted upon. If you miss out of the initial breakfast serving 2 hours before landing be prepared to starve until arrival - very unimaginative. With a near full flight good refill of toiletries is essential - not so on this flight. I would be rather reluctant to try out the Washington and New York service if maximise sleep is top of the list - re shades and cabin lights. Given the price paid I would fly them again. Maxjet to and from Las Vegas in march this year and found the flights excellent. Space great service very good and the food outward bound super but not so good inbound - lack of choice and they should not run out of options with only 79 to feed! Lounge at stansted and fast track great - we wait for the lounge at Vegas! Al in all well done and we will use maxjet again STN-LAS-STN. Slow check-in resulted from repetitive process. Before reaching the check-in counter passengers are first screened in the queue asking the same security questions at the check-in counter [same process not adopted with BA/Silverjet etc]. Superb in-flight service although food quality and quantity were a bit disappointing. 2 choices of hot entrees lamb and beef - whatever happened to fish for vegetarians? Lamb without any sauce wasn't very tasty. Seats 1980 biz class but comfortable enough. DigEplayers good - flights on time. Toilet very old and not very clean. Overallvalue for money. One disappointment that crew show little interest in restocking toiletries. Stansted to Las Vegas return. Check-in for both flights excellent. At Stansted fast-tracked through security with no problems. Maxjet lounge at Stansted was great plenty to eat drink and read. The cabin crew on both flights were excellent very friendly nothing too much trouble. The seats were very comfortable food and drinks excellent. Personal media-player is a nice touch and comes pre-loaded with latest films videos TV shows and a good selection of music. Booked on this airline month a ago to fly Chennai to Hyderabad. Airline cancelled the flight without providing valid reason and did not offer any acceptable alternative. Did not accommodate on an earlier flight even though there was a scheduled flight. Offered refund at such short notice and had to buy another ticket at a premium (5 times the cost originally paid). No apologies and ordinary people like me feel trapped. My experience on SpiceJet was the worst I have ever had. It started off right from Dubai airport at check-in. My flight was meant to depart at 23:10hrs. The display said 23:10 when we entered the queue and within minutes the display for Delhi departure turned to 02:20hrs. A member of the ground staff came to the queue and announced all Delhi passengers to leave the queue as the Delhi check-in had been closed - no reason was given. So my son and I left the queue and sat down in the waiting area. After about 45 minutes we asked another member of staff and we were told the check-in had re-opened - no announcement had been made though. After check-in I contemplated returning home and coming back 2.5 hours later - when I asked how I can get accurate flight status I was told it is best to hang around at the airport. Even the SpiceJet website would not give up to date information as the delay was owing to incoming flight being diverted to Mumbai. So we decided to stay on airport. The flight was further delayed to 03:30hrs. After an uncomfortably long wait we finally boarded. Everyone was tired and the cabin lights were dimmed after take-off. I thought I should use the washroom before settling down. To my horror I found there was no soap or hand towels. When I asked the cabin crew they said \"sorry madam, it is finished. This flight was diverted to Mumbai and the aircraft was not serviced in Dubai so we have run out of supplies\". I returned to my seat and tried to get some sleep. The rest of the flight was uneventful but devoid of service of any kind. There was no drinks and snacks, even though it is meant to be a paid service. Not even water was offered to the passengers - only those who asked got it. At one point I woke up and went to the galley to ask for water and the air hostesses were asleep! Unacceptable standards of service. Agreed SpiceJet is a budget airline but even so there is something called professionalism which was totally lacking here. Needless to say, I am not looking forward to my return flight. Travelled on 3rd March 2015 to DEL-KOCHI and KOCHI-DEL on 8th March 2015. DEL-Kochi was a pleasant journey. As it's a low cost airline there was no inflight entertainment. We had opted for pre-booked meal options but we've got SMS that food will not be served. When enquired with the cabin crew they didn't have any concrete answers. Anyway flight landed on time. Kochi-DEL. Flight was scheduled to leave at 7pm from Kochi but delayed by 1.5-2 hrs. It was scheduled to stop at Mumbai but changed to Hyderabad. At Hyderabad no one was sure whether we continue in the same flight or change planes. After 10-20 mins we learnt that we needed to get on another plane. Again we got the message that meals are not available in the flight and even no water bottle given to us in all the flights. I am not sure why they still have the meal option on their website. In terms of ticket pricing rates are cheaper than other airlines but it doesn't matter if they are not able to provide the basic things. DEL-DXB. Check-in was chaotic but ground staff were efficient and helpful. Flight on a new 737 but legroom was tight but the seats were ok for a short 3 hour flight. Service was extremely inefficient it felt like the cabin crew did not go through proper training. It took them more than 2 hours to service the entire aircraft and we were lucky enough that we pre-ordered our meals beforehand. Also they served our meals first before our drinks which should have been the other way around. We nearly choked waiting for our beverage. Food however was of excellent quality. The quality and quantity were great and while it was just a basic meal the taste far exceeds that of other major airlines like Emirates. Overall a mediocre flight. While crew was a just a little bit friendly the service efficiency was just a disaster. We have booked and paid for 5 flights with SpiceJet. Of those 5 three were cancelled without any issues with weather/external circumstance (i.e. all internal SpiceJet operational issues) and one was delayed by 2 hours. Only one flight managed to make it to the destination on time. Worse SpiceJet does not pay for hotels or offer any sort of recompense when they cancel a flight due to operational issues (including not having enough passengers) all they offer is to book you on the next available SpiceJet fight (note that they refuse to buy you a ticket on any other airline) which is usually the next day and forces you to either pay for an additional hotel night out of pocket or lose a night that you had already paid for. They don't even offer to make the seat selection free after forcing you to change your plans completely. The additional 250 rupee charge is just a slap in the face after they tell you there is nothing they can do about completely disrupting your travel a day before you are supposed to leave. They are the worst Indian airline. Not only does SpiceJet not get you to your destination on time you're usually a day late. I purchased 3 SpiceJet tickets to travel on weekends over the last 2 months. Every flight was either delayed more than 2.5 hours or flat-out cancelled and I have never been offered anything (other than an \"apology\") for my troubles. The first flight was delayed 3 hours due to mechanical issues. The second was cancelled 1 hour prior to departure with no warning due to mechanical issues on the inbound flight. They had no flights available until the following morning. Some passengers on the flight missed international connections the value of their international flights was forfeited and they had to pay hefty change fees. I took my refund and had to hire a driver who drove me 7 hours overnight. My flight tomorrow (Thurs afternoon) was cancelled due to mechanical issues. They couldn't find another plane so I will have to fly out Friday morning as it is the only flight available. They refused to put me on an Air India flight that was at the same time as my original flight. Their customer service is pathetic. I will never fly SpiceJet again. PNQ to MAA return. The experience was pretty bad. The airline advises customers to arrive 2 hrs before scheduled departure we arrived 1 hr 45 mins prior to departure and the check-in counter was closed. There was nobody at the Spicejet counter. Had to wait 30 mins. Then told that the flight was delayed by 1 hr due to the aircraft from Delhi arriving late. When we asked for a single row seating at the front they told us that we would be charged 500 rupees per person for the front row. Had to forcefully opt for second last row seat. The flight arrived departed on time the aircraft was fairly okay the interiors and the night lighting was great but overall not a good trip - expected lot more from Spicejet. My husband and I flew SpiceJet and I must say it was an overall bad experience. Flight was booked for 10.30 am and at first the flight was delayed to 12.20 pm after which I received a call stating the flight had been further delayed to 1.50pm. I fail to understand why there was a 3.5 hour delay. The staff at the counters did not offer any solution apart from the manager whom we contacted at the end. I travelled 4 domestic flights with Spicejet November 2012 Delhi - Varanasi Varanasi - Delhi Delhi - Goa and Goa - Delhi. All 4 flights were delayed from 30 minutes to more than one hour. This made reaching connecting flight very difficult and I almost missed a flight back home to Europe because of that. I pre-ordered food on all this flight and got the same meal every time. Once the meal was delivered just a few minutes before the preparing for landing instructions came. So in fact I hadn't time to finish my meal. Altogether my experiences with Spicejet were negative. 21-01-2013 BOM-COK Boeing 737. The check-in procedure was quite disorganised with the longest possible line for any airline I could see at Bombay. Their website says you cannot do web check-in if you need to check in baggage. For an early morning flight this rule makes you leave home at least half an hour before other airlines. Staff allotted me an aisle seat in the non-reclining row before exit without informing me since I am relatively tall the leg space was quite insufficient the only reason to be thankful was the gentleman in front of me did not recline his seat. Overall have had better experiences on other Indian budget airlines like Indigo. Staff are good but could do with some more training. Would I fly this airline again - perhaps but the price will need to be good to consider this alternative. We were flying to Trivandrum from Chennai. The journey takes about one hour fifteen minutes. The flight was announced and we boarded at 6.30 pm and were supposed to take off at 7 pm. No announcement till 7.15 pm. When passengers approached the cabin crew they did not know what was happening. The flight crew was arguing with the ground staff. There was nothing to eat or drink. The pilot announced that there will be some refreshments but nothing came. Finally after an hour and half the flight took off. We reached Trivandrum around 9.30 pm. The experience was awful. If there was an issue the airlines should have delayed the flight instead of boarding passengers and make them wait on the Tarmac without any option of cancelling the journey or even getting refreshments. We never did the mistake of taking a Spicejet flight again. This is a low fare airlines that appeals to many budget minded travelers. However the airlines baggage policy is completely out of line with the international standards. For example most international carriers offers checked-in luggage up to 23 Kg while SpiceJet is only 20 Kg. The carry-in is limited to 7 Kg only. When you check in your luggage after arriving from overseas journey SpiceJet charges 200 Rupees per Kg an extraordinarily high rate. Checking-in Staff are eager to charge and seldom give a consideration to a traveler's appeal. One feels trapped as there is no option. My advice to SpiceJet increase the weight limit to 23 Kg and institute a flat fee in Indian Rupees equivalent to $25 dollars for an extra piece of checked-in luggage not the 200 Rupees per Kg rate. My advice to international travelers do not expect any concession from ground staff; most of them are trigger-happy to charge fees for extra weight. BLR-DEL. Smooth check in friendly ground crew. We were flying their 737-900 aircraft. Poor seat pitch. I'm 5'11 and my knees kept knocking the seat in front. Agreed Economy airlines offer bad legroom but this was hopeless. Luckily I was the only person in my row and could get some extra room by reclining the middle seat. Food is not free as with most budget carriers rates are good. Keenly priced tickets. They take a practical view of baggage allowances which is very helpful. Overhead lockers are somewhat low and can be awkward for odd-shaped carry-on bags. FAs are very courteous. Seat pitch is unsatisfactory but for short flights this may not pose a problem. CJB - DEL (via HYD). Departure punctual arrival late due to endless approach into Delhi. Whilst you get what you pay for in terms of service on this type of airline I was surprised at the rudeness of the CC. When on the ground in HYD one of them addressed me as if I was an inmate in a prison camp for wishing to use the toilet. However in the air with turbulence warning and seat belt signs on pax were walking up and down to the toilet freely. Mumbai-Delhi check-in did not take very long. Seats were pre-assigned as the flight was full 20 mins delay departing. B737-800 cabin clean. Seat pitch very tight. Food for purchase was a good selection of snacks and beverage ie. sandwiches cookies muffins tea coffeeetc. Cabin crew disappeared after food sale and only returned to collect the trash. Overall a good experience except for the very tight seat the price was extremely competitive. BOM-DEL and IXB-KOL. Both flights were heavily delayed. Was the worst Indian airline in terms of punctuality and service. Also they seem to get the furthest possible bays which means taking almost an hour from the plane to the airport after landing. I would not fly with them again. Delhi to Srinagar via Jammu. The time of my web-booked flight had changed but I had not been notified of this and therefore arrived at the airport far too early. Luckily there was an earlier flight and the person at the ticket counter changed my booking to this flight at no extra cost. Seats were allocated at check in but there was no scramble anyway as there were only 100 passengers. The 737-800 was clean and the crew were quite friendly. Overall a positive experience - but Spicejet have already started cutting routes and frequencies so things are looking tough for the Indian locos. Pune to Chennai return. Flown for the first time with them and found them okay. Planes were new and clean. Both flights were on time. FAs well groomed and do a good job. Food served was not free and was more of a snack. For the fare they charge you its a very good airline to fly with in India. DEL-CJB (via HYD). We chose this flight for its convenient timing. SpiceJet's ticket office at Delhi Airport is very hard to find (as an exception to the rule it's located outside the temporary ticketing hall). Check-in friendly and efficient. Boarding via a bus with a ridiculously high step. Flight left on time meaning we actually lifted off the runway at the scheduled time of 1710 (a miracle given today's crowded Indian airports). Onboard catering limited and expensive. On the second leg (HYD-CJB) there were two incidents of altercations between cabin crew and pax mainly over the issue of the complimentary water bottles not being provided (ostensibly because of turbulence preventing service although the seatbelt signs were NOT on) yet the FAs were happy to serve anyone who wanted to purchase any food or beverages. These two unpleasant situations were not handled well by what came across as a particularly arrogant FA. Landed in CJB on time. PNQ-HYD. I booked with a foreign credit card which caused a bit of a delay at check-in. All boarding at Pune is done via remote stands though it was done quite efficiently and we actually pushed back 5 minutes early. The plane was a B737-800 and it was clean and well-maintained. The FAs were efficient and friendly. There's no IFE at all but since the flight time was only 1 hour it wasn't a big deal. Main complaint was the seat pitch which seemed a bit tight though it was manageable for a 1 hour flight. Being an LCC you had to pay for everything on board except for water but the prices are reasonable - 20 rupees (about 50 cents) for juice and 60 rupees (about $1.50) for a sandwich. You also have to pay to pre-reserve a seat online but again the cost is negligible at 50 rupees (about $1.25). If you are booking online also beware that you will be offered trip insurance after you select your flights and the default is set to yes so pay attention before finalizing your purchase. The flight arrived at HYD about 5 minutes early and although my bag was the last on the carousel it only took about 10 minutes to appear. Overall a good value for the price I paid at about $52 for an advance purchase one-way ticket. AMD-HYD return quite happy with the product. New B737-800. Were offered soft drinks & peanuts on a 1 hr 15 min. flight. FAs attentive and efficient. On-time performance both ways. Can't really fault the offering. I'd rate it as above average LCC experience. DEL-BOM-DEL. A good and cheap budget carrier. New spotless aircraft friendly service and flights were in time. I have no complaints at all except the horrible Delhi airport but that is not the fault of Spicejet. Everything about Spicejet reminded me of Easyjet if compared to an European low-cost airline.\n"

air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,Ranjit Pradhan,United States,2015-07-28,"The positives: The Dreamliner is an excellent and new aircraft and for once everything on it worked and was clean and well maintained. The lie flat bed in business was excellent. Much more spacious than the United product or the Smartium business bed on Asiana and others. The layout of the seats is a bit different - less privacy but more open feeling and real space. Comfy duvet and blankets provided on this night flight. Cabin crew although older (55+) were very well trained, warm, polite and efficient. They came around repeatedly talking to the passengers and making sure we were comfortable and seemed to genuinely care. In fact their efforts helped overcame the other deficiencies in the hard product. Compared to the brusque automatons on United these folks were full of smiles and eager to please. Also the Indian food selection was delicious. The negatives: compared to the premium airlines AI is clearly not as polished or well organized. Meals were provided all at once in a single tray - not course by course as on other airlines. Menus was not provided. Wine choice was very limited. Champagne was served lukewarm. After dinner the crew disappeared and did not patrol the aisles refilling glasses - but then passengers were asleep and I'm sure if anyone had requested they would have come right away. Movie selection though limited was not as bad as I had imagined. It would be nice to have served a quick snack or wake-up drink prior to landing. It was strange that the only announcement we got to wake us up was the one saying we were preparing to land! Overall a good product and definitely exceeded expectations. Not on par as Singapore, Emirates and Asian carriers but solidly good overall.",Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Shanghai to Delhi,7.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,1

Took 1.5 hours to fix during which time lunch and drinks service was offered. Once fault repaired flight underway almost 2 hours late. Little time made up of passage to Melbourne so arrived about 1.5 hours late which did squeeze connections from Melbourne. Air India had rebooked passengers who missed their connections and this was communicated on arrival as to new flight details Flight was comfortable with 2 meals plus snack and drinks offered.

My first connection BOM-DEL was delayed with prior intimation which was fine. I reached DEL at the eleventh hour when the boarding for PAR had already begun. I met the worst ground staff at DEL airport who don't even know how to behave with a passenger and behave as if doing a big favour. I was not attended by any transit desk people and when contacted the AI staff asked me to run behind people on transit to other destinations that was just so cheap. Next thing was the annoying security check which took nearly 30 minutes with a quick immigration for transit passengers. The flight was quite empty and quite comfortable, with friendly cabin crew. But the flight was mostly full of foreigners and the announcement was missing in French and the really fast Indian English was really sad for the French people who kept asking me to translate what they meant. Arrival in Paris was very smooth.

With this level of service, punctuality, leg room and price Air India is a good option. The negatives - I ordered a special (DBML) meal on the return flight but did not get it. Also Air India's online check-in has a glitch - I've faced this problem five times in the past (out of five attempts). The problem - at the end of the online check-in screens after entering passport and visa details, the system flashes an error message.

LHR-DEL - Experience was again a let down. To begin with we were 4.5 hours late, though we were informed well in advance. We finally boarded the aircraft and the first images of worn out carpets and shabby seat upholstery made the already disgruntled passengers more upset. Food was served very fast and lights were switched off!

Staff only does the process of rushing through meal service thrice during the 15 hour flight and switch off lights rest of the time - unlike some of the good East Asian airlines, there is no one regularly going through the cabin to see if passengers need anything. One can always go back and ask for tea/coffee. There is water/juices kept in the aisle but they really don't come back to see if replenishments are needed. In-flight entertainment inadequate for such a long flight. Flight path either not switched on in time or grossly inaccurate. Safety vests hanging out from below most seats.

The first leg I flew business class on an A321. This was sub standard for business. The food was poor and the aircraft was very tired and dated. On checking in for this flight the staff were rude and displayed a distinct lack of awareness of time when checking in a large group. They refused to let us use the other business class desks for check in and this resulted in the plane being delayed. Our connection through Delhi was rushed because of this delay with us having to run through the airport. The 777 flight to LHR was outrageous.

The food was good enough even though a bit spicy but better than what was on American Airlines. The crew were also polite. Overall experience was pretty good.

Using their website for anything but purchases and seat selection was a waste of time. Endless circles asking and re-asking for information. Calling their help center was also somewhat futile due to language issues and lack of proper training. Our outbound flight was delayed 5 hours but the airline did call and text with the news. So that was decent of them but no apology for the delay and we lost half a day in India. Seats had uncomfortable cushions and were tightly spaced. Luckily the flight was quite empty so most people had 2 or 3 seats to themselves outbound. In-flight AVOD could be good but the touch screens were not working so well and the hand held device was worthless. Flight back was delayed by nearly an hour due to late arrival. Same uncomfortable seats and slow touch screens. Service both ways was efficient limited and far from gracious. Announcements were few.

air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,J Kaur,United Kingdom,2015-03-25,The second occasion I have flown with Air India and I must say it was appalling. Whilst my international flight from BHX to DEL was on time as scheduled my connecting (domestic) flight was 2 hours late due to Air India wanting to fill planes before they depart. This happened on one occasion however due to my family members travelling on the same flight on different dates within the space of two weeks they also experienced the same delays for again no apparent reason. There is no communication from the airline and there is no concept of customer service. I experienced further problems on my return flight from ATQ to BHX on 15/3/15. My domestic flight from ATQ to DEL was fine on time and a pleasant flight all to become disastrous on my arrival to DEL at 11.20am. We (ATQ passengers to BHX) were left on board the plane as the plane was to continue on the BHX. The flight was due to leave at 13.15pm however this was delayed by over 2 hours apparently due to a missing manual which it was apparently unsafe to fly without. My family and I were left sitting on a plane for over five hours with no communication food and general ability to move around. On asking flight attendants for information and food both requests were denied. Bigger doesn't not mean better and this was most certainly the case with Air India.

The man laughed at me and told me that flight was full so I had been moved to one at 18.05. I asked how that could be when I had a ticket for the 13.30 flight and yet it wasn't showing on the board. He then said that there was no 13.30 flight and that there wasn't nothing he could do. I was looking at eight hours in Delhi airport. No apology no explanation. I then asked where the left luggage store was that is advertised on the airport website. He told me it did not exist. Staff insisted that I would have to check the bag at a cost of 30000 Rupees (£300). All staff were unhelpful and rude. Eventually a guy working at the suitcase wrapping stand told me where to find the left luggage store which is in the Metro station. I checked my suitcase for a week for 3500R - £35). Flight was delayed by another two hours - I arrived in Kochi at 1am and missed the beginning of my organised tour. Return flight was just the same - arrive at the airport flight doesn't exist. Not just my flight - lots of passengers had booked on earlier flights but simply been moved. My plane should have left at 4pm giving me lots of time for my connection at 3.40am. We were still sitting at the gate in Kochi at 10.45pm. We only got on the plane after there was a near riot and passengers insisted that the plane not be cleaned but that we should just be allowed to board. I was too late to make my connection back to London. At no point at all did I receive anything like an apology or explanation. This just seems to be how they do business. Never again.,,,Economy,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,0
air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,S Friedman,United States,2015-03-20,Flew PVG-DEL return (and Delhi to Kochi return) in economy. Flight from Shanghai was very smooth super empty Dreamliner left on time very comfortable. The Delhi to Kochi flight was very delayed but otherwise fine. The DEL-PVG leg was a disaster. We took off on time and made very good time there was a storm over Shanghai so we circled twice before landing at an airport about two hours away. Totally understandable these things happen. But we were then held on the tarmac for more than 4 hours with no water and with two of the bathrooms out of order. We got very little information and crew did not push for our release. I understand the Chinese ground staff just didn't come but Air India has to fight for its passengers rights - more than 4 hours with no food or water! We could not use the bathroom! The plane was beginning to smell. This was so poorly handled and has really put me off Air India.,,,Economy,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,3.0,0
air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,A Gordon,Australia,2015-03-19,I flew Air from Sydney to Delhi and return because it was a non stop flight. On entering the aircraft it looked old and I found that my touch screen did not work. The toilets were disgusting smelt and were stained. Some panels were hanging loose. The floor was awash. On return the aircraft looked newer but the toilets were still disgraceful. I had to fly via Melbourne which was a pain in the neck as we had to disembark in Melbourne and go through a stringent security check again. On take off the cabin crew did not do a safety check of passengers and we took off with one passenger asleep across three seats unrestrained. One passenger had tray table down and that was what I could see from my seat. The cabin crew avoided eye contact at all times. During the long overnight flight from Delhi children were allowed to run amok. Food mediocre. Would never use again.,,,Economy,,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,2.0,0
air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,P Andrew,United States,2015-03-19,Chicago (ORD) to Delhi (DEL). February 2015. I booked ticket on website and went to the airport with check-in and carry-on bag. I got a surprise at the counter the person told that I can carry only 4 Kg carry-on baggage. This was unexpected. Finally moved some luggage from one bag to other on airport and took receipts of the bag. Onboard: The crew served snacks and water but I needed more water I was searching for crew but couldn't find them. The crew returned after some time and served more food and drinks. On a 14 hours non-stop flight this should be their practice. Food was good - in taste and quantity. Entertainment was okay. Seat was comfortable with enough legroom a very important thing for 14hr non stop flight. What didn't work: 1 or 2 restrooms ran out of tissues towards the end of the journey. Though it was a long journey crew should have done something to improve this. Overall: Apart from the restroom issue I didn't feel that anything went wrong. Overall flight was a very good experience with plenty of foods drinks good seating okay entertainment.,,,Economy,,8.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,1

Had I been put on my previous flight I would have landed in time to catch my connecting flight to Amritsar. The flight was again delayed by 3 hours and no explanation was given to us.

On BOM-DEL sector we loved the chicken and after telling this to a female flight attendant she soon came back with more chicken and was very happy to serve us more. Absolutely delightful!

The aircraft operated was an Airbus A320. Check in was smooth and hassle free. The inbound aircraft was delayed from MAA (as its a MAA-TRV-SHJ flight) and the departure hence got delayed for around 45 minutes. Frisking by Air India group security was done prior to boarding. The interior seats were comfortable and clean. The attitude of the cabin crew as usually complained was poor. One of the aged crew was serving food even without asking whether non-veg or veg. Few of the passengers including myself had to ask her to change as she simply gave the non veg without asking.It seemed they ran out of veg meals.

Absolutely the worst experience we have had on an airplane. We never saw the fight crew except when they served hot meals and a drink before the meal on a 14 hour flight. This was the only contact we had with the crew. We actually saw the crew sleeping during the flight instead of serving the customers. The crew never came around and offered drinks or snacks however drinks and peanuts and sandwiches were at the service stations and we basically served ourselves. Never have we seen or experienced such a thing. The entertainment was pretty good however many of us in our group had consoles that didn't work and remotes were not functioning either. The bathrooms ran out of paper and the cleanliness got worse as the flight continued. After 14 hours you can imagine the results of a lack of hand towels and toilet paper in an airplane. Basically there was no such thing as cleanliness. Let's talk about the seats. Where we sat was like a rock! The bottom was hard and the back you could actually feel the frame. Numbness was a way of life for 14 hours. Eventually we got creative and figured a way to make our seats ""comfortable"". Some used their pillows from home for their back others used the pillow and/or the blanket from the airline for cushioning. Basically these seats were the worst!",,,Economy,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,,,1.0,0
air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,Rawlinson Alan,United Kingdom,2015-03-04,LHR to MEL via DEL and return on deeply discounted ticket. Flight from New Delhi to Melbourne delayed in 1 hour increments with no final departure time given. Air India ground staff had no idea when the flight would eventually leave and weren't bothered about it either. After about 5 hours in an attempt to force Air India respond to the situation the other passengers began physically preventing the one remaining ground staff at the gate from leaving and then blockading the other Air India gates in the terminal to prevent boarding. By this tactic several other flights were delayed amid lots of shouting and chanting of slogans. Eventually a crew was taken off a Hong Kong flight to operate the one to Melbourne and we departed 9.5 hours late. The on-board service was mediocre and the IFE not fully functional on two flights. The seats folded into a horizontal flat bed (B787 aircraft) and were quite comfortable. Given the delay in New Delhi and the manner in which it was handled there is no way this airline can be recommended no matter what the ticket price.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,2.0,0

Old A-321 aircraft with faded seats and no inflight entertainment system. Surly cabin crew who had a feeling that they were doing a favor to passengers. On the Chennai-Dubai sector the passenger sitting in front of me asked for an extra can of beer during dinner only to be roughly ticked off by the cabin crew. The reason given was that they only serve one can of beer per passenger. I have flown hundreds of miles on various airlines but this is the first time that I am hearing such a ridiculous explanation.

They ran out non-veg selection after a while and when queried by one of the passengers the answer given was that they had loaded more veg meals with the assumption that not many people would take non-veg on a Thu.

Missed our return connection from MAA in the morning but the airline was kind enough to rebook us in an evening flight and gave vouchers for lunch given by some cold faces in the airport.

It was spotless and the seats were very clean and so was the entire cabin. The crew were excellent always smiling and helping the guests. The seats provided extreme comfort with ample leg space. The only suggestion that comes to my mind is AI should make sure that they change the menu because the last time I flew AI 675 in Nov' 2014 the same breakfast was served (Non Veg). The flight was extremely comfortable. The return leg was on 23rd January 2015 (AI 775). The flight was delayed by about 90 minutes however I have no complaints because AI kept informing me through regular calls and texts about the exact status. The aircraft used in this leg was an old A319. The seats were torn and in some cases even the back rest was not upto the mark. I don't understand if AI can use their 787s in other domestic routes why not in the BOM-CCU sector? If not then why can't the A319s be replaced with the A320s which provide much better comfort. This is just a suggestion as I love flying AI. I would also like to appreciate the fact that in spite of the flight being delayed by 0 minutes we were served dinner on board. The dinner was excellent. Last but not the least I'd like to request AI to please reintroduce the entertainment system for the domestic sectors also so that we can enjoy the flight even more.,,,Economy,,9.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,,,5.0,1

Flight was a little unpleasant also because of the strong turbulence and a bunch of young crying kids. FA's were a little rude at times but always available.

Surprisingly both the sectors went smooth as compared to my first experience (read below). The crew were polite and accommodating and breakfast served on domestic sector was tasty although tea and coffee was like black water. International leg had only 30 passengers so was a very light flight. Crew made an exceptional job with very polite rounds of drinks lunch snacks and special plum cake served always with smile and were more than happy to serve larger portions. The younger crew made all the efforts to make flight comfortable by dimming the window and switching off unwanted TV screens and always attended passengers request. AI 787 Dreamliner have great legspace that beats all European Airlines although AI should urgently update their entertainment system.

Very poor staff service and as remotes are broken you can't call attendants - deliberate? Toilets are very dirty and we ran out of toilet tissues. Had to remind staff. No cleaning of toilets as on most other airlines. Staff are lazy. Some exceptions but did not make up for non attentiveness. Could not believe poor movie choice - latest movies were two years old and most between 5-10 years. Issued good headphones but I used my Bose and relied on my own entertainment. We usually left late and the plane system is very poor in showing estimated arrival time. Food was poor. Was expecting some dinner and got served a snack which was terrible.

air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,Sean Mckenna,United States,2015-01-14,AI120 26th December. Arrival at FRA – discovered we could use any of the LH business lounges. Arrived at terminal A so used the brand new A lounge for a couple of hours (had a 6hr layover). Then took a trek to terminal B popped in to the lounge for an hour or so. Similar layout and food. Reception staff very pleasant. LH lounges are pleasant enough good selection of drinks food is at best minimal and quite uninteresting. WIFI is good – easy connect and quick enough to video skype. The B lounge is right next to the gate so it really is a 1 minute walk. No calls though and the monitors only show the boarding times so be careful! We strolled to the gate to find we were the last to board. Greeted very politely by the crew issued new boarding cards and shown to our seats which were taken. The interlopers were swiftly moved on and we sat and made ourselves comfortable. A choice of drinks was presented along with a hot towel and some eye masks. The crew were really nice a mix of ages and all were very pleasant courteous and helpful. Cabin décor leaves an awful lot to be desired but the seats are spacious and very comfortable. Not as garish as some of the pictures but definitely not easy on the eye. No sooner had we levelled off then the crew came round offering pre-dinner drinks and shortly after this it was time for dinner (it was a late flight). Flight crew arrived with cotton tablecloths and served either a chicken shashlik or prawn curry served with the usual naan rice and vegetables. Vegetarian options also available. Prawn curry was yummy. Washed down with a decent red wine. Slept the remainder of the flight to Delhi. 2nd Sector Delhi transit is a right PITA. Slow cumbersome numerous passport and boarding card checks. Eventually made it through (luckily at the front of the queue – if you had a short transfer you'd be in trouble). Lounge is pleasant. Except for some building work going on just outside. WIFI is incredibly difficult and awkward to connect to. Couple of PCs available. Didn't eat whilst we were there so can't comment on the food. Found a couple of recliners and slept for an hour. 10 minute walk to the gate boarded and departed right on time. Again the crew on board were really pleasant and very attentive. Mixed ages again. Greeted with drinks and hot towels. Limited movie choices. Again the food choice was limited but what was provided was delicious. A decent white wine this time and copious G&Ts combined for the next important stage of the journey – sleep! Seat is again a proper lie flat. Padding a bit thin but if you sleep on the duvet they provide this cushions the seat cover. A thin blanket (also provided) is enough as a cover as the cabin is warm. Got woken about an hour or so before landing and had a really nice chicken biryani for breakfast. Bit odd but not much else to choose from. Landed smoothly but unfortunately no priority bags on arrival. Not a big issue but would have been nice. We consoled ourselves that the bags had arrived at all.

The last trip I took was on the last week of December 2014. Pros - Flight is pretty much always on time and the fare is reasonable compared to most other international airlines on the same route. Cons - The seats are not so comfortable firm dirty as if the covers have not been cleaned or washed in a long time. The crew members are not of the standard to be aboard an international flight. They just lack service quality compared to the likes of Emirates or Qatar. Very unprofessional. They only show up during refreshment services. Care less to see if any passengers would need assistance with anything else through out the flight. They don't clean the rest rooms or feel the need to fill in tissues once these runs out. Half of the entertainment systems are broken and rest are just slow. They also barely update the contents in the entertainment systems. I traveled back to back in two months and found same movies.

All the flights I have taken so far have been smooth and excellent - take-offs landings and en route. Service is generally excellent and they surprisingly serve a small snack with unlimited water. I have invariably requested and obtained emergency exit seats with ample legroom. Toilets are clean again surprisingly but smell a bit. The main thing that needs to be improved is the maintenance of the cabin. The carpets are worn and the leather seats need refurbishing. The interior of these 738 aircraft need a good scrubbing. But other than that AIX does well on this route.,,,Economy,,8.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,,,5.0,1
air-india-express,/airline-reviews/air-india-express,Air India Express customer review,Shlok Misra,United Arab Emirates,2015-01-14,Flew from Dubai to Lucknow and back to Dubai. The crew seemed bored and the service was horrible. The table was broken and the meal served was inedible. The toilets were dirty. The seats were uncomfortable which made spending those hours on the aircraft unbearable. Choosing Air India Express was a poor choice in spite of the low cost tag attached to it.,,,Economy,,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,0
air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,Liam Moulton,Indonesia,2015-01-11,LHR-DEL-BKK. Ticket was cheap and onboard food was as good as you get in Economy class. However I found the cabin crew to be lazy as they never responded to the call button meaning I had to go to the galley when I wanted something like a drink. Also the entertainment was disappointing because although it was video-on-demand the selection of decent Western films was limited and there was no Western music only Indian. Furthermore the staff at Delhi Airport were so rude with far too many checks yet insufficient staff that meant getting through checks at Delhi during transit took far too long. Basically I will only go with Air India again if it is dirt cheap.,,,Economy,,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,,,4.0,0
air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,V Ladhani,Germany,2015-01-05,FRA-DEL-MUM: 30th Nov 14. Ground staff to aircraft crew were just disinterested. Passengers were greeted by young friendly crew but that's it. Other members clearly were not happy with their jobs. Captains announcement were rather short and straight. Seats still had bread crumbs on them and tables had oily stains this was on a new 787-8. Drinks had restricted choice. Cola or Juice. Food served in aluminium foil was shabbily presented and was overcooked. Crew members never gave service with smile although they did attend when called. Domestic sector was better than international flight. Aircraft was extremely old with tattered carpet and food was again shabbily presented but crew were polite and accommodating. Air India its time to pull up your socks as a part of star alliance passengers will choose to other airlines to your shabby service. Lack of Professionalism was very evident!,,,Economy,,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,,3.0,0
air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,Ron Kuhlmann,United States,2015-01-05,"DEL-BKK. They got me there (not my bag however). I was on a new 787 in Business and the interior was a bit dowdy and there was a large chunk of my window armrest missing exposing the foam beneath. The amenities were slippers and an eye shade in a paper bag. The crew was present but not really involved with the passengers outside of the necessary interactions. All the meal offerings were Indian with one being vegetarian. It was all served on a single tray and the wine ""selection"" was red or white - served from half bottles. The overall experience was equivalent to a similar 4 hour sector in the US in First where the product is improved over coach but the flight did not measure up to other international carriers.",,,Business Class,,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,4.0,0
air-india-express,/airline-reviews/air-india-express,Air India Express customer review,Harsh Gidwani,United Arab Emirates,2014-10-12,Apart from having point to point connection there is nothing else that this airline can offer. I flew from Dubai to Amritsar and back and found this trip rather exhausting and uncomfortable due to the airline service. Being a budget carrier does mean to save costs but its doesn't mean to keep your aircraft's dirty and unhygienic. When I entered the aircraft both the times I felt as I am traveling in one of those public buses which are disposed for public use (to be honest even public buses are well maintained that Air India Express aircraft's) the crew looked angry for no reason it felt as if they were punished to come here and serve us they did not have the decency to speak politely with passengers and just dumped their frustration on us. Food was awful as everything looked stale and had no taste. Since this was the only flight available for me to reach Amritsar I was forced to take it.,,,Economy,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,0

My return journey (Pune-Dubai) was a nightmare. On arriving at the airport in the early hours of the morning I realized that my flight had been delayed for reasons unknown/unannounced to me. Then delayed 40 minutes in the security check line because other domestic flights need to be released earlier. After much delay I arrive at the final gate only to see no information displayed about my flight. Its delayed further. No one at any counter to enquire for any information. Felt relieved when the announcement to board was being made but there was more to come we were made to sit inside the aircraft as the pilots did not have clearance from ATC. It turned out to be for an hour or more until we finally were given clearance to fly. So a trip which I chose on purpose to save time and money did everything else but those two things.,,,Economy,,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,3.0,0

Seat quality could have been improved. No common inflight entertainment too as airline fell short of earphones for passengers so did not distribute any.

The flight departure times of the first leg Mumbai-Delhi (AI809) have been changed 3 times since I booked the flight in September. This has caused so many uncertainties with hotel booking in Mumbai. The final departure time was delayed by 3 hours to 7AM thus making it an uncomfortable morning on the day. To add to the misery when I reached the airport I learnt that the flight is delayed by 2.20 hours.

Air India ground services handled by local handler DNATA was a disaster. Check in was relatively smooth but boarding gate was changed from C13 to C7 and there was no announcement to inform passengers. The crowded boarding gate was disorganized and no proper announcement was made to give priority boarding. Flight crew seemed to be less interested in service. Food was good and service was quick. Inflight entertainment was decent enough though live flight map was not available. Seats were little shabby and was in need of maintenance.

air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,A Kuznetsov,Russian Federation,2014-12-29,I flew DME-DEL-GOI-DEL-DME in mid December. What can I say - before making the first flight with AI I thought it wouldn't be the best experience. Now the reality: staff are polite and efficient both on international and domestic segments. A bit unorganized on the ground. Food - good. It's Indian expect curry but a very good curry and quite a large portion. aircraft's: all-new 787 and 319. They are just new and I have nothing to complain. Entertainment system is not to Emirates standards but quite close to that on Lufthansa's new 747-8.

I have selected this flight because the holiday season started and IX was the cheapest available from UAE to Kochi. After my disastrous trip by Air India last month on the same sector I was not expecting much from IX but I should admit that I was surprised. Nice and clean aircraft with enough legroom polite cabin crew who were attending the passengers with a smile and on time take off and landing was part of the surprise package. And all these were for half the price of the next available airline.,,,Economy,,8.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,,,5.0,1
air-india-express,/airline-reviews/air-india-express,Air India Express customer review,S Modak,United Arab Emirates,2013-08-26,"DXB-PNQ-DXB. Check in was smooth at DXB T2 and I managed to get 1C. The plane from the inside looked a bit shabby as most AI aircraft somehow do but I was happy for the extra legroom for my 6'3"" frame. A very overweight couple took seats 1A and B after smiling sheepishly at me. The man was overflowing into my seat. I saw that 1D was empty and moved over. AIX served a flimsy cardboard box containing a sandwich a small packet of banana chips something fried and inedible and a muffin. Strange assortment but better than nothing and welcome on a low cost carrier. Unlimited water as well. Drinks are chargeable. Flight left about 30 minutes late but arriving into PNQ was a breeze and I was home in 10 minutes after leaving the airport. Check-in in PNQ for the return leg was chaotic as usual and the woman insisted my bags were overweight. I smiled a lot and finally after I removed my laptop from my hand luggage she let me go through and even gave me a reclining exit row seat. The seat bottom was worn out and the metal bar kept poking my rear. When I asked for a blanket (even a used blanket) I was told they had run out of them. I avoided serious long term damage to my tailbone by moving and shifting through the flight. Same food was served on this leg. Overall it was good value for money. But basic maintenance a word missing in India's lexicon could be better. Sitting on metal for 3 hours is no fun.",,,Economy,,6.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,,,5.0,1

air-india-express,/airline-reviews/air-india-express,Air India Express customer review,M Haridas,,2008-12-27,I am regular passenger in UAE-Kerala route. Flights seems to be fairly reasonable compared to the fare structure and clean. Crew helpful. But the snacks to be supplied as per the timing. On mid night flights supplying banana chips and cakes really upset the stomach. Any toasted bread sandwiches (veg or non-veg) would be more ideal which will not add up the cost to the airlines. The fare calculation methods seems strange. Sometimes a person buying an online ticket far earlier before 1 or two months pays more than someone take it on the day or previous day of the flight. Also the taxes calculation. More basic fare is with less tax and vice versa. Recently the cancellation charges have been increased to 35% which is really unbearable. It should be reversed to 10% before 10 days and 15% prior to 24 hrs at least.,,,,,3.0,,,,,,,,0

Connecting flight from Delhi got changed without any information. The transit flight schedule changed from a waiting time of 1 hour to 6.5 hours. When enquired and made a complaint we got put on an earlier flight which had 4 hour wait this was because we had a child passenger. Landed in Delhi airport to find out that even the changed connecting flight was delayed. Waited for 6.5 hours in the airport for the connecting flight. My little boy was exhausted and tired and our holiday mood completely ruined with such a bad start losing a whole complete day of your holiday due to your airline's fault is not something you want to experience again.

The flights were on time the comfort was adequate and the staff generally reasonably friendly. The only slight downside was the quality of food offered in the snackbox - barely edible pastries and deep fried cookies. However the flight is only about 4 hours so having little to eat wasn't a big problem. The tickets were 50% cheaper than the only other carrier to offer non-stop flights on this route (Singapore Air) so overall I was extremely pleased with Air India Express.,,,,,4.0,,,,,,,,0

Aircraft quite new and thanks to being seated in one of two emergency exit rows lots of leg room. Despite travelling on a low cost airline you nevertheless are served a snack consisting of sandwich cake fruit juice water coffee or tea. On the downside the passenger next to me was allowed boarding in a clearly less than sober state and the crew continued to serve him hard liquor throughout the flight (alcoholic beverages available on a for sale basis). He even managed to complete the entire flight without ever having availed of the seat belt. Also despite being a non-smoking flight crew were quite relaxed at seeing the lavatories being used continuously as smoking rooms - with the obvious and objectionable result of extremely bad air quality in the cabin throughout the flight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Staff from Singapore to Chennai did not give us menu cards but Chennai to Singapore the staff did and found time to talk to us and explain the meals. Inflight movie was good.

I was lucky enough to get upgraded to business class. Seats and cabin was extremely comfortable and seats reclined flat. Service was good and friendly but it lacked the professionalism experienced on other premium carriers - the younger staff not as diligent as older staff. Food was good although the red wine was exceptional. Inflight not great but still had enough variety to pass the time. Return flight was on Boeing 777 in economy- surprised by the amount of legroom and comfort of seat - better than BA! Again found older staff better than younger staff. Food was disappointing although no worse than BA - I found the pre-landing snack inedible. Also I found the control functions for lights games and tv were not working. In fact the tv for both my wife and son were not working at all. Luckily I had my tablets and iPad! Overall I found AI no worse than travelling on BA.

Lounge pretty ordinary with limited food and drink and leaking showers despite being fairly new. Flight to Sydney (via Melbourne) left an hour late and on 787 Dreamliner which was very new with more spacious seats and cabin less than 1/4 full. Food again decent curries very friendly service slept for about 8 hours. Inflight TV hopeless on both flights unless you are into Bollywood so take an iPad.

After 2 hours I was given overnight accommodation and booked in the morning flight to Hyderabad. I had the same bizarre experience on my return flight to Sydney via New Delhi on 23/10/2014. I got a phone call a day before the flight that it has been modified and will leave couple of hours early and will go to Delhi via Vishakhapatnam. The flight from Hyderabad was delayed again by an hour due to check-in system being down which again resulted in me missing my connection to Sydney. There were 8 passengers connecting to Sydney and a notification by the captain was not good enough to save our day. It does not end here at immigration I had my departure stamp and as I was waiting for my wife and kids passports to get stamped when the Air India staff informed us that the flight to Sydney is now closed and we can't board the aircraft. It took another 4 hours to do the paperwork to cancel the departure stamp on my passport. Then the routine of going to hotel and take the flight the next day. There is no sense of customer service or sympathy at this inconvenience. I would make every effort never to fly Air India again. The only good thing about the journey was the plane itself. There is ample legroom the seats are comfortable and the dreamliner 787 windows are dimmed to give night experience. Flight staff service varies person to person - some are good and others indifferent.

As for the flight it was great we had premium economy seats great food on time good service and a no-bumps ride. Also not to mention one of the most engaging pilot who gave us stats on every single item relating to the flight-it just felt good!,,,Economy,,10.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5.0,1

air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,Khundmir Syed,Australia,2014-10-22,"Travelled from Sydney to Delhi on 04 October AI301. Got a notice via email that flight was delayed by 20 minutes but the flight took off 2 hours late hence I missed my connecting flight. Requested an aisle seat they issued me a boarding pass with 15G when I was about to board the aircraft they gave my seat to another passenger without even consulting me and then they changed my seat to 12E. When I reached the aircraft I found a passenger sitting on 12E. I spoke to cabin staff who said they will look into it which they never did when I confronted her again she said sit wherever you can. I heard the staff suggesting to 2 passenger with same seat number to keep switching seats during the flight. I requested a special meal which they said they didn't have. When I reached Delhi Airport I was advised that my flight had left and will have to take another flight the next morning. They said they will arrange a hotel I waited for 2 hours for that to happen and I had to approach staff again to get this done. They took me to something that they called a hotel but it was ugly and under construction. I said I didn't want to stay there and they said we have another property. Entrance to that property was via the kitchen - I didn't even check the room and asked to be dropped back at Delhi Airport. I was made to sign a receipt of 2500Rs for the 30 minute stay at their hotel. All airlines are sometimes late flights get cancelled and all sorts of things happen but my problem with Air India was that no one had a slightest clue of what they were doing. When I spoke to the manager he said ""Do whatever you want"" I don't have authority to do anything and there is nothing that can be done tonight. India is a great nation and Air India brings shame to this great nation by associating itself with this great name. Absolutely irresponsible clueless and have no regard towards basic human feeling.

air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,Suhail Shafi,United States,2014-10-22,New Delhi to Srinagar and back. While in the past I have had reservations about flying Air India I found their overall performance better than I had previously anticipated and expected. There are two newer perks with flying Air India. The first is the new Terminal 3 at New Delhi which is modern efficient and clean a huge improvement over the previous Delhi airport. Flying in an out is a breeze with the newer terminal offering a large selection of amenities. The second is the membership of Air India with the Star Alliance making earning frequent flier points possible. The DEL-SXR sector was served by an older A320 - comfortable seats in one class configuration with no special amenities in an older layout. Service consisted of hot beverages with biscuits - not exemplary but adequate for a short flight. Srinagar had been affected by floods at the time of my departure so the Air India staff graciously allowed us to leave the city three days before our scheduled departure. The plane was a A330 with modern seats offering excellent legroom with tasty refreshments. The aircraft sported a modern looking interior with restrooms under the main cabin - something I had not seen before - with no inflight entertainment but perfectly adequate for a short flight. Air India may be one of the more underrated airlines out there. Despite its financial difficulties their inflight product has improved markedly over the years and their Star Alliance membership and modern hub in Delhi makes them attractive to fly with both on short haul and long haul flights. My expectations were low but I was more than satisfied and I would consider flying with them again.,,,Economy,,8.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,,,5.0,1

air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,Samuel Sherine,India,2014-10-12,The Dreamliner flight from Sydney to Delhi was a disappointment. 1) Seats were very cramped. Not adequate leg space for such a long flight. 2) Toilets were dirty and toilet tissues were not replaced. 3) The entire economy seating area smelt. 4) A snack and a drink was very much needed before landing. Just two meals for a 13 hour flight was not adequate. 5) Fruit juice and diet drinks were not available after the first meal service. 6) A wet wipe or steamed towel should have been provided at the end of such along flight.

air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,M Hay,Australia,2014-10-12,"CDG-SYD (via DEL and MEL). Check-in was a mess at CDG - told to leave executive line and wait to the side - then told to get back in to executive class line after waiting for several minutes to the side. AI use Cathay lounge for this flight at terminal 2C and its really nice. 787 Dreamliner for both legs. My overall impression is that this plane is massively over hyped from a customer aspect anyway - there is really nothing special about this plane - the windows are the most noticeable difference- and while this is nice during the couple of minutes during taking off and landing - you don't notice it for the rest of the flight. Everything is plastic on this plane - the toilet door feels like an ice cream container lid. The seat is comfortable in bed mode it is wide and well padded - but there is no Z-mode for relaxation - you can put the backrest back and the footrest up but the seat remains flat at all times - its not really that comfortable for relaxing/watching TV. A sat in cushion and a larger cotton pillow are provided - which are very comfortable in addition to a duvet and a thin blanket - which makes a great sleeping experience. IFE screen is large and high definition - there is a reasonable choice of (both Indian and Western) movies and television shows - but not quite enough to stretch out for the 12 hour flight. Food was variable. No menus provided - options were stated by staff at the time of meal service. Out of CDG the supper was lobster with champagne sauce - it was dry and tough - but definitely still lobster which is great in business class. Otherwise all the other meals were curry and sandwiches were offered on the Melbourne to Sydney leg - really this should be a proper breakfast. An announcement was made that no alcohol could be served on the domestic leg from MEL to SYD - what they actually mean is no duty free alcohol can be served - its pretty cheap to stop serving alcohol just because you have to pay the duty on it. Almost all passengers immediately removed their shoes and socks immediately upon boarding - so be prepared for the feet. The staff are a mixed bunch - some are fantastic - friendly smiling communicative and anticipating requests - these staff were all female. Unfortunately the male staff were some of the most surly resentful and unpleasant people I have ever encountered in a business class cabin - attendant call button was met with a ""yes"" and a glare from these men. The lounge at Delhi was interesting - I was there at from 9-12 am this is a big lounge with many comfortable chairs but limited food and drink options. Showers were available. Wifi was difficult to access staff seemed disinterested and resentful of requests for assistance - there is clearly no customer service mentality about this place. Overall this was a very average experience and certainly the worst business class flight I have ever taken - however the price was very reasonable and I would consider booking it again and I would cautiously recommend Air India.",,,Business Class,,6.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,4.0,1

Check in was easy and hassle free. Boarding too went smoothly. Flight departed 10 minutes early. Aircraft was brand new fresh. Cabin was spacious and seating arrangement was a comfortable 3-3-3 layout. Contrary to expectation the seat width was not wide enough and there was a general discomfort in seating. Inflight entertainment was excellent with a wide range of movies and shows. There were 5 regional movies available in my native language an experience never found in any other flights. Food as usual was very good though the crew were asking passengers whether they are strict vegetarians as they were running out of veg meals due many passengers pre ordered veg meals.

air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,R Priestley,Australia,2014-09-22,I was excited to be travelling on Air India's new 'Dreamliner' from Sydney to Delhi yesterday. The experience fell well short of my expectations. I endeavoured to do on-line check-in but it was not available so I phoned and requested an aisle set. That request was never registered but the check-in assistant in Sydney gave me an exit row seat which I was very happy with. On the flight the entertainment system for my seat 30C was not working. I initially complained but I was dismissed by the first flight attendant and told I would need to wait for it to cut in. After an hour of waiting I approached another flight attendant who assured me he would re-set the system. Following another few failed attempts I was assured that they would register the fact that it wasn't working and that it would fixed for the next passenger. Not sure how that helped me! When it came time for meal- time the flight attendant asked me to pull out my tray and was irritated when I couldn't. The tray was actually broken. She did endeavour to fix it but it remained a problem throughout the flight. Unfortunately the entertainment system appears to control the overhead lighting as well. The result was that I had no access to movies music or reading light for the full flight which is 12 hrs 30 minutes that's a long time to sit in the dark. There was no apology or understanding from staff. The food was very basic with little variety there was minimal genuine service on the flight. Staff seemed to vanish between meals and seemed irritated when a passenger asked for something. If anything I found some of the staff quite rude. This was a very full flight I think staff need to pay some attention to the toilets during the trip. At one stage one of the toilet basins was clogged and another passenger complained to staff. I do a lot of travel and this is the worst flights I have taken. I would endeavour never to fly Air India again but from Sydney to Delhi there is very little choice of operators.

But I have to admit after traveling to Calcutta and coming back to the US that I am quite satisfied with the service offered by Air India. Staff were courteous professional helpful and food was excellent. The only complaint I have is the seat quality the seats are extremely uncomfortable almost felt like I was sitting on a piece of wood during the lengthier legs of the flight (Newark to Mumbai Mumbai to Newark). Seat quality is very important especially for a 16 hour duration flight. Surprisingly the seats were roomier and a bit more comfortable on the flight from Mumbai to Calcutta.

No one met me at Bombay but the worst part was they refused to provide any assistance. The supervisor at the baggage claim told me in no uncertain terms ""we will not help you."" I had to file a claim for my luggage with Turkish although I never checked my luggage with them. We were so distressed and tired but not one Air India representative showed any concern and they refused to let us in the shuttle to domestic airport.

air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,D Beard,Australia,2014-07-29,Flew the Dreamliner from Singapore to Frankfurt via Delhi. They had their new (plated) catering on board but still the choice and quality disappointing and the service average which is a shame as Indian food can be outstanding even the curry option was very disappointing. The cabin crew in business on whole do not seem comfortable or confident and are usually older. I mention the age issue only because I think that they have been used to a different type of service which no longer is the standard for business class. I appears that the business cabin crew are chosen on seniority and Air India needs to change this and use younger crew who can bring a new attitude and freshness to the service. Having said that the seat for sleeping was excellent with nice large pillows and good quality cotton quilts. The Dreamliner definitely delivers a much better cabin comfort and had a major affect on jet lag. We had 1.5 hr scheduled transit in Delhi which was a worry we ended up with 60 mins to complete the transfer which we did ok as we had already been issued boarding passes in Singapore. Having said that value for money is excellent. I know many have disliked the decor and I have to agree that it doesn't come up to Cathay's but its ok.

Food: curry was the only option and catered for Indian passengers. Very limited option (no alternatives). No child's meal provided requested at the time of booking and it was not available (so if you are travelling with children please take your own food). Refreshments only served with meals not provided in any other times considering the long flights on all the sector. Entertainment: Is mainly aimed at Indian audiences very limited entertainment and games for kids (suggest taking a tablet/DS loaded with your favourite movies or games to keep them occupied). The senior management need more focus to improve the standard and efficiency as Air India has joined star alliance they need to improve on following to be par with other major airlines and to attract more passengers with different nationalities. Cabin crew must improve their customer service. More variety of food option for all ages especially for children. Refreshments are served on regular basis on long flights. Noted that toilets are not cleaned during the long flight and some are unusable due to cleanliness. It appears that cabin crews not checking are more interested in resting in their pods for majority of the flights. Improvement on on-time performance as our both outbound and inbound flights are delayed.

air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,L Bendle,Australia,2014-07-06,"Overall the service on the flight was inline with other international carriers. The food was acceptable curry was the only option and I suggest that all passengers opt for the ""veg"" option. Entertainment is mainly aimed at Indian audiences and I expected and agree with this. I suggest taking a tablet loaded with your favourite movies or shows - but I would do this on any airline. The 787 is by far much more comfortable that the 777. Very impressed with the 787 (Dreamliner) - leg room is normal the seat pitch is incredible the cabin environment is lovely and the atmospheric conditions are noticeably better on the 787. (I didn't think this after the outbound journey which consisted of two 787 sectors. The return journey was a 777 sector followed by a 787 sector this is when you notice how great the 787 really is). Transit via Delhi: Information around this process is extremely hard to find on the internet with mixed reviews on sites such as this. If you are an international transiting passenger (i.e. you have landed in Delhi and are connecting with another Air India flight within 24 hours) then you do not need a visa so long as you are not exceeding 24 hours and are not leaving the terminal. There are two options inside the terminal for accommodation. I have done both. Eaton Smart Hotel - transit hotel - This is the option for a transit greater than 4 hours. If you stay here you can also leave the hotel and access any facilities in the terminal - just keep you passport and boarding card with you. Sams Pods - Ideal for less than 4 hours. $10US/ hour. You have access to a bed TV and desk in a small pod in the terminal building. No access to wash facilities other than those provided in the terminal. If you have a flight with Air India and have a long transit it would be well worth you questioning your ability to get a hotel paid for by the airline. I paid for mine as advised for by my flight centre agent. All other passengers on my flight managed to get this included in their ticket free of charge.

Our plane was delayed due to a technical fault. We were served food around 14.30hrs but deplaned around 18.00hrs. We were taken back through immigration and left to stand in the exit lobby for 3 hours. We were bussed to Heston Hotel but no accommodation was available. After waiting outside for over an hour we were bussed to accommodation in Bentley Hotel reaching well past midnight. No meal provided. Next day (July 2nd) we were bussed after breakfast to Heston Hotel for lunch then to the original departure lounge at LHR. Flight was scheduled for 14.30. Then 16.00hrs. At 19.00hrs we were given meal vouchers. Finally we boarded after 22.00hrs. The flight took off at 11.30 hrs 31 hours late. At no time was information given voluntarily. Air India agents mostly left it to LHR staff to take care of angry passengers. No provision was made for passenger comfort particularly families with small children and the elderly. Passengers were made to stand for hours in areas where there was little or no seating. No effort was made to provide meals at reasonable intervals. We had to ask for vouchers. Passengers were not informed about the plan of action resulting in frayed tempers. Our luggage was not handed over to us. Aisle seat 11c restricts free passage quite severely. Passengers occupying this seat are trodden on and bumped by boarding/disembarking passengers. Except for the centre block row 11 has nowhere to stow small belongings not even under the seat. Many passengers did not know how to flush the toilets resulting in filthy conditions. Instructions must be given along with the safety check. Buttons operating screen light etc on the inside of the armrest can be accidentally knocked.,,,Economy,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,,2.0,0
air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,S Krish,Canada,2014-06-30,I travelled on Air India from London(LHR) to Chennai via Bombay. The first leg was a brand new 787 it is great product seating 3-3-3 and much better leg room then any other airline. I am tall 6.2 ft still I find very comfortable seating. On board we had 3 servings one drinks service with beer wine and spirits one good full meal with choice of Chicken fish or veg options and one snack before landing. For 8 an hours flight - lots of food. Good quality food and we enjoyed it and there were desserts too! Inflight entertainment was good with choice of new Hollywood and Bollywood movies TV shows sports and business section - enough to keep us busy for 8 hours. FA's were good lots of smiles and caring for kids and elders. Toilets were kept clean all the time. Flight landed in Bombay full 30 minutes ahead of schedule. The second leg was an A319 again good product hot breakfast served with choice of either Scrambled eggs and potato or South Indian Veg. We all enjoyed the breakfast. Air India has improved a lot and now stands on par with other international airlines. I will fly again and recommend fully.,,,Economy,,10.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,1

air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,S Drapaku,United States,2014-06-30,Traveled from NY (JFK) to DEL (IGI) in May 2014. The ticket was slightly more expensive than other airlines but the flight was half empty. The plane was a Boeing 777-300ER with a very nice cabin and a 3-3-3 configuration (unlike 3-4-3 on most other airlines). I requested the air hostess to move me from the front row to some empty seats behind and she happily did so. I was in the center aisle and both seats besides me were empty I could sleep (laid on 3 seats) all the way through without any disturbance. The food was excellent staff was good and the in- flight entertainment was nice (not the best but you will like it esp. if you are an Indian). Flight was on time.

Early morning departure from Amritsar with 2 hour stop over in Delhi then it was 7am when we took off from Delhi. The flight to Delhi was 50 mins on an airbus A321. Was given juice and a snack. No complaints. On the international leg it was a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The flight was brilliant. I cant complain. The leg room was great (I flew economy). Even when the person in front reclines their seat it isn't uncomfortable. The IFE was excellent. Fast and easy to use. Plenty of movies to choose from mainly Bollywood with a few regional choices too. Maybe not so great on the Hollywood selection. The breakfast wasn't the greatest but for airline standards it was ok. Later in the flight lunch was served. It was lovely. I had the non veg option. It was chicken rice and also saag. It was probably one of the best airline meals I've had. The crew were well presented and hospitable. The flight was ahead of schedule too. Plane was spotless. I would definitely recommend Air India.,,,Economy,,10.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,1

The new Dreamliner 788 is a great plane a lot quieter more room to move about cleaner air and large windows. Left and arrived early. Business class half empty so the service was very good not quite as good as the Asian airlines but more than satisfactory. Seat comfort was fine and the lay flat bed made sleeping easy. The entertainment was good watched 2 movies in English. Ordered special food which was my mistake and cannot blame the airline for the disappointing food. The snack between meals (smoked salmon) was most enjoyable. The extras included a nice travel suit better than Qantas pyjamas duvet and pillows were comfortable and travel socks and eye masks supplied. Second leg Delhi to London plane service and entertainment as good as the first flight. Food. Gave up on my special meals and ordered from the menu. Breakfast (Poached eggs) was fine and the dinner (Supreme of chicken) served just prior to arrival as good as any meal I have had on a plane. Fresh fruit to finish.

She is 82 years of age and had a broken vertebra 6 months back and after my trip to SYD/MEL last Oct-Nov I decided that the transit is pretty good at Delhi and my mother could go unaccompanied in Business Class. The flight arrived 45 mins ahead of schedule at JFK and being a passenger in a wheelchair she was absolutely thrilled with the care the AI staff bestowed on her. The only issue I faced was getting a wheelchair at Chennai airport as the AI counter was closed and I was not allowed inside - but security staff were kind enough to offer a seat for my mother and advised me to get an AI staff and fetch a wheelchair. My mother informs me that the connection in Delhi (to AI 101) was very smooth and she was well taken care of. She was full of praise for the cabin staff. AI has definitely turned over a new leaf and there has been a tremendous improvement in their attitude as well as service - their hub at T3 Delhi is much better than what prevailed in Mumbai and the ground staff are wonderful at Delhi!,,,Business Class,,9.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,,5.0,1

I ordered a VOML (Vegetarian Oriental meal) less than 6 hrs prior to departure but my surprise it was offered to me on the plane. I must commend the Crew who make a huge effort to satisfy passengers on the plane since most of them are first time flyers and seeing Drinks/Food being free they want to extract the most they can.

Comfort - This is what the trip is about. Kudos to AI team for having their Boeing 777-300ER to be configured as 3-3-3 seating instead of 3-4-3 seating which many airlines do this translates to excellent seat space and good leg room. The trip has perfect timings and usually reaches Delhi well ahead of schedule. Food - Being from Indian origin I liked the food which is hot and a little spicy. Entertainment - Now many would want a great entertainment units for this flight and even would have made plans to watch a lot of things inflight well don't this flight is great to sleep and rest. The movie selection was not great and their interface needs improvement Crew - Now there are a lot of small things that make an airline great and I do tend to see them from the captain speaking about the journey and enthusiasm of the crew with a big smile each time they serve.

JFK-DEL is 15 hours. The seats had their cushioning removed the entertainment panel only partially worked on 1 flight and didn't work at all on our return flight. The flight maps did not even work on any of the 4 flights. Cabin maintenance (or lack thereof) made me question their mechanical maintenance. Flight attendant service was horrible. People were still in the aisles when they pushed off for take off and jumped out of their seats as soon as we touched down - opening overhead compartments etc as the cabin crew ignored everything. Too busy talking in the galley. No comments at all from the flight crew about the 3+ hours of terrible turbulence after leaving Delhi. The cabin crew routinely locked one of the coach bathrooms for their own use which meant 2 toilets for about 200 people. They never walked through the cabin before or after meal service. As a former flight attendant who has flown millions of miles on different airlines I can say this is the worst airline ever.,,,Economy,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,0

The reclining part of the seat is also not very much. Food is served quickly after the drinks are served. I was told that it is AI policy not to allow passengers to mix drinks. There was no wine on AI 111 and I think only red wine on AI 112. When I requested a second drink (AI112) I was asked why did I not ask for a larger drink first time. The food and staff were ok.

Our flight was cancelled at Amritsar due to weather conditions they decided to take us by coach to Delhi the coach provided was very basic and there was no Air India staff to look after passengers. We were not provided with food during the journey that took about 17 hours when it should have taken only 6 hours there were children on the bus who were very disturbed no provisions were made available. When we got to Delhi there was no Air India rep to greet us and direct us we were all lost and did not have any information we were all running around from pillar to post to find out where to go and get some info when they should have looked after us at least when we got to Delhi. We were very disappointed with the whole service they clearly don't know how to provide customer care so I will never travel with them in the future.,,,Economy,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,3.0,0

Excellent set of crew on the flight (all female operated flight) pre-booked for VOML (Vegetarian Oriental) was served promptly - after I ate I greedily asked for more food and was again promptly given a regular Vegetarian meal with a warm smile and was told to just call if i needed anything else.

Average service from the Indian staff at Bombay Airport no eye contact no greetings just come and go types. Crew again all female crew including cockpit welcoming and pleasant - but midway through the flight after the meal service things changed. I moved to the last empty row so my wife and I both could get some sleep however one of the crew members walked up to me and told me I could not sit there.

On 20th Feb Dubai-Goa the flight was scheduled at 11pm but took off at 12.20am. The delay announcement was very brief and no one was available at the gate for comments. If passengers were told even at 7-8pm in the evening it would have avoided rushing to the airport. Food specially for children could be managed by us etc. We were left standing as there was nowhere available to sit. No entertainment onboard the seat in the front had a torn pocket which had a wire coming out which could be very dangerous for my child. I had ordered a children's meal however on the flight back on 8th March none was given.

air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,N Seenivasan,Germany,2014-03-03,The FRA-DEL leg was delayed 24 hours due to the heavy fog in Delhi (not Air India's fault) but they quickly and painlessly transferred us to a Airport Hotel where we had to spend the night. Air India even arranged for Indian food at the Hotel. Flight took off on time the next day at around 4pm and the Dreamliner was as usual excellent. Great leg room good food (though the portions were tiny the Steward quickly fixed that on request by providing me with an extra tray) staff attentive throughout. What surprised me was the attentiveness of the Stewards towards parents with young kids. Came to check up on the parents multiple times and kept the kids happy with candy and cola. The DEL-HYD leg was pleasant and on time. The return journey HYD-DEL-FRA was uneventful and on time. As a regular traveler on this route I can only recommend Air India for their great service.

air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,Stefan Thordersen,United Arab Emirates,2014-03-03,My wife and I flew from Dubai to Goa and back. Check in Dubai was pleasant and the lounge offered average. On the flight to Goa there was no entertaining system available and very limited selection of beverages. Flight back from Goa via Mumbai to Dubai was however a complete nightmare. Check-in in Goa was very slow and there was no lounge facilities available. The flight it is self was OK but on arrival to Mumbai passengers from economy class rushed forward thus generated a chaotic that crew did not have the capabilities to manage. On arrival to Mumbai (3 hour stopover) we headed to the lounge offered but were not allowed to access as check in staff in Goa had not given us lounge access slips. After half an hour we were finally allowed to enter. On arrival to the gate we were informed that the aircraft had been dispatched from the gate and we would have to be re-routed to another flight. We now were asked to leave the departing area as it was necessary in regards of our rebooking and we had meet up with a duty manager. This process took 1.5 hours and finally we met up with the station manager. We did not have any other option than to buy a new ticket for the following day.,,,Business Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,0

Told by uninterested ground staff flight was changed to different gate. Went to new gate and waited for 90 minutes and finally asked what time boarding would begin. Told flight was delayed by 1 hour due to late arrival of incoming aircraft - no announcements no information nothing. Ground crew stood around chatting on their cell phones as passengers got annoyed and angry. Finally boarded 90 minutes late and hustled into seats.

A friend was raving about the new Dreamliner. End up disappointed. Nothing special other than the fancy lighting on its windows and interior. The remote did not work thank goodness for touch screen TV. Food choice was either veg or non veg only both Indian cuisine. Portion was small ended up asking for a snack 3 hours after lunch was served. Cabin was messy by end of flight too many children on board unfortunately. Good points: Cabin staff were attentive to requests. The female crew uniforms are an old style definitely need a modern design.

They made no attempt to warn us beforehand so we had no opportunity to remain elsewhere. They made no attempt to book us onto associated airlines towards our destination. Instead 2 hours later we were bussed to a hotel miles out of Delhi City. Having eventually boarded the next day's Air India flight to Australia we then sat and waited 2 hours on board with no service and only a single (late) announcement as to the reason. Something about late incoming connecting pax. So we eventually departed 2.3 hours late from Delhi arrived 2 hours late in Melbourne 1.8 hours turnaround there eventually arriving at our final destination Sydney.

Many aspects of the service were good but not consistently good to rival better carriers. Choice of English films/music very poor with virtually no new films or music available.

The lie-flat seats were fabulous with cleverly designed spots to store your things. It was on time. Cabin service was fine if not notable. Ditto entertainment.

However there seems to be more legroom. The international flights often come out a lot cheaper - so accept poorer conditions for economy! However the worst part of the flights I've done is the security at an Indian airport. It's atrocious and to be avoided if possible. My last trip travelling from Bangkok to London took more than an hour and that was on airside. To make it more infuriating my hand luggage was searched 4 times and not one was a decent/thorough search - more like they were going through the motions!

At Chennai airport for an A320 flight they had only 3 operating check-in counters whilst planes from other airlines had 5-6 counters. This led to long delays and lengthy queues. The Air India ground staff at New Delhi airport seemed to be helpful in helping the passengers getting to their connecting flights. The Dreamliner for the Delhi - Sydney leg seemed to be a good one. The flight was delayed by 3 hours due to 3 stewards reporting sick at the last moment and they had to bring in replacement crew. The announcements were spotty and not easily forthcoming. The food served was tiny in portion with only one round of drinks offered for a 12.5 hour journey. The IFE was limited but worked. The toilets didn't have any amenities for a long-haul flight.

We left BKK on time and the first leg was around 4 hours on a fairly old A320 which looked a bit shambolic but did the job. Staff were almost comically surly as a first impression although once you engaged a bit they got better. They dealt with some very rude passengers so in the end we sympathized them more than anything. There was simply no IFE at all but I had brought a book so that didn't make too much difference. The pilot guided us very well through a long patch of turbulence and we slowed right down near landing in response to fog at Delhi. Overall it was pretty poor but pilot seemed experienced and we got there safely so not complaining. The connection was ok and we had a slight delay due to aforementioned fog but this time we were on the 787 dreamliner. Lovely modern aircraft with decent IFE but nowhere near as good as Emirates though a lot is invested in Bollywood stuff. The toilets could have done with cleaning. The food was reasonable with the lamb curry on the first flight the best and all were passable if not great. Staff were a little more enthusiastic on the 2nd flight which was good although the audible ""bing"" sound every time anyone requested crew assistance was unnecessary.

Booked 9 months in advance to get a good price for the peak season and felt it was good value because everything was perfectly fine with the Dreamliner (seat pitch cleanliness meals staff service with a sense of humour at times good on-time performance IFE). The domestic sector was served by an older single-class A320 which was far inferior to the Dreamliner but the staff were good both ways and served hot meals during the 2 1/2 hr flight. Cannot fault Air India in any way and loved the Bollywood films onboard the 787. However the transit arrangements at Delhi International Airport are a nightmare which easily bring the spirits down after a good flight. Air India management should work closely with the authorities to make transit arrangements flexible because their European flights (LHR CDG FRA) as well as Melbourne/Sydney seem to depart within an hour.

air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,Mark Wilkins,United Kingdom,2014-01-13,London-Delhi-Bangkok return in business class. Got a very good deal back in May which was only £100 more than my usual Etihad economy trip in economy for the dates. There were some good points to the trip but several bad points to mention. All flights on time except last leg back to Heathrow that was compensated though by my bag being first off. Lounge quality was varied which I'll review separately. LHR-Delhi on B777 - very good seat for sleeping (slept probably 7 hours) though privacy lacking. Good choice of drink selection but food for business class very poor in both presentation and quality. No amenity kits on board for overnight flight. Entertainment on demand but western choice limited with only 3 recent films. Delhi-BKK. Poor all around for a 4 hour flight except the seats were wide and drink choice good again (malt scotch whisky). As noted before chicken or veg should not be the default option for business class and the quality of both was poor even for airline food. No immigration forms on board and fast track vouchers only offered on landing after numerous requests from passengers. Entertainment system on the A321 from the 1990's - no on demand and a choice of 5 channels 1 English. Ended up watching an Indian cop movie. BKK-Delhi - more of the same but breakfast of better quality. Delhi - BKK - although late best of all the legs with attentive cabin crew calls answered on request for drinks a good quality meal this time. Still could see the cost cutting with the amenity kit in business class being a cheap pair of flight socks and eye mask. No explanation given either of 90 minute delay.

The only reason I travel AI is because of its ample legroom for a person of 180 cm like me.

Seats were uncomfortable and dirty (some parts falling apart and they even use strings to keep them intact). There were no TV screens for this 8 hr long flight. Cabin crew just ordering and are very rude. There is no meal selection and they just ask whether we want 'Veg' or 'Non-veg' so you have to eat whatever they give you. Once in BOM I had to get the new boarding pass for BOM-EWR sector. There was a 13 hour transit so I was told that I will get light refreshments and the dinner (they wrote this on boarding pass) but didn't tell me where to get them. So after security check I was roaming in the terminal to find an AI agent but couldn't find. I went to their lounge and showed them the boarding pass and asked where to get their so called refreshments. The person let me in and asked me to use the facility. After sometime another person came in and asked me to show the boarding pass and invitation card. Then I showed my boarding pass and he said the lounge is only for invited passengers so I should leave in 5 mins and he said the previous person let me in by mistake. So I went out and was waiting for freaking 13 hours in busy crowded Mumbai airport. Its a horrible experience. BOM-EWR AI 191. This was a new flight with in-flight entertainment (with poor movie/TV selection though) but the same rude behavior from cabin crew. Again no meal selection.

One Air India ground staff member announced that boarding would commence for rows 1 to 15 while another commented that boarding would start from rows 16 onwards. This obviously resulted in a confused queue of people. The welcome on board was pretty average however the seating (comfort and leg space) was just fantastic a luxury I had not experienced with other airlines lately. Only tea/coffee cookies and a bottle of water was served which is really appalling given that this is a 12:50 pm departure. Thankfully I had carried a sandwich with me as I had read about the cookies in another review.

The cabin was quiet throughout the duration of the flight. Magazines only offered to first cabin? Crew could not work out my gluten free meal and kept having to replace my tray after serving. Cabin was too hot during shut-eye time and no waters handed out before sleeping. Amenities kit just socks and an eye mask however asked crew for toothbrush/paste which they supplied immediately and then left a pile in the toilets.

Cabin crew definitely surly however once smiled at they immediately smile back. Drinks service was fine however only given a packet of French-fry style crisps seemed a bit amateur for executive class. My pre-ordered gluten-free meal left the crew somewhat perplexed and I was met with the response ""veg or no veg"" as an option. 'No veg' was nice enough however the chicken main contained only 3 small chunks of meat. The IFE was not on demand and the cabin was very hot and stuffy throughout most of the flight.

air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,Vikramaditya Singh,United Kingdom,2013-12-23,Chicago to Delhi in First class. The ticket cost almost 2x business class in a European carrier but I chose it due to the direct nature of the non-stop flight. What a mistake. The first class product is very poor seats uncomfortable and felt like sitting on a metal rod. Cabin service was pathetic with a poor choice of drinks and food. And most shocking is Air India has stopped giving toiletry bags. If you are going to fork out the money do it on Qatar or British Airways.,,,First Class,,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,1.0,0
air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,Bhattacharya Mallicka,United Kingdom,2013-12-19,Was travelling to Kolkata on AI 020 on 15 December 2013. The flight was 11 hours late owing to partly absence of aircraft and no alternate arrangements in such exigency and partly the unavailability of crew. The 250 odd passengers didn't have a clue on the reason for delay. No AI officer bothered to put in an appearance to explain what the problem was the handling staff were equally in the dark. Though meals were supplied no formal announcements were made to inform the passengers of this and one learnt mainly by word of mouth from other passengers who had come by the information accidentally. We arrived Kolkata at 2.30 am and many had to spend the night at the airport.,,,Economy,,,2.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,,,1.0,0
air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,Simranjit Kaur,Singapore,2013-12-17,Singapore to Amritsar with a transit in Delhi. The domestic flights were much better than the international flights in every aspect. Upon check-in the officials insisted that our luggage had to be checked out in Delhi and checked in again when the final destination for the luggage was clearly stated as Amritsar on the luggage tags. The same happened on our way back. My 83-year-old grandmother was with me and she has difficulty walking so we requested for a wheelchair for her. Due to this we were the last to get off so that my grandmother had more time and could get off slowly. When we landed in Delhi from Singapore for transit there was a delay in bringing in the wheelchair and the female flight attendant who was apparently in a hurry to get off told my grandmother to walk out and wait outside the plane for the wheelchair. Domestic flight attendants showed more care and were very accommodating towards my grandmother. In-flight entertainment was not working to Delhi and there was no in- flight entertainment to Singapore on the old plane which was quite run-down. Our flight to Singapore from Delhi was on 16th Dec 12.05am and we landed in Delhi on 15th Dec after 4pm for transit. When we tried to enter the international airport the security officials refused to let us in asking us to come back 24 hours later as the date written on our boarding pass was 16th Dec. They refused to listen when we explained our flight was 5mins after midnight. We went to the Air India customer service counter where there were other passengers with the same problem. She simply told us to keep our boarding pass and show them our booking confirmation instead which we did and the security did not accept. The customer service officer refused to come out of her counter and speak to the security officials for us. We managed to enter the airport 3 hours later. We also had to request for wheelchair assistance again and the customer service officer told us to wait while she went to get the wheelchair. After making us wait for 40 mins she returned with 2 cups of coffee and no wheelchair. Upon entering the international airport there was a whole new problem with the Air India officials. On reaching Singapore we realised that there was no communication within Air India for the wheelchair assistance. The air stewardess instead told us off that we should have requested for assistance earlier which we did repeatedly. Overall the experience with them was horrible as they created inconvenience for us every step of the way but certainly eye-opening to see that their service could be of this standard.,,,Economy,,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,3.0,0

A very old A320 in all economy configuration. Cabin smelt of stale sweat and was incredibly hot. Of 3 toilets one was shut up with packing tape and looked like it had been for some time. The other 2 were filthy and stank of urine by the time we got to Delhi the floor of the front one had been covered in newspaper to soak up 'liquid'. At least on 3rd class Indian Railways you would not have had windows! My seat had a table located in the armrest it and its housing were filthy. The other armrest had a liftable cover and filled with food scraps and wrappers.

He was supposed to leave Delhi on Air India and change to Delta Airlines in Dubai to travel back to Atlanta GA. He originally had a 6 hr layover in Dubai. However Air India changed their departure out of Delhi to Dubai from 3pm to 8.40pm without notice. This put my son at a 20 minute connection time. Air India said sorry that is only flight to Dubai so nothing they can do. They refused to transfer him to another airline out of Delhi to get him there on time. He would just have to wait until he gets to Dubai and see if someone could help him there. To make matters worse we had booked this reservation through Travelocity.com so now we had a third party involved and they all blamed each other. Nobody at airport or their so called ""customer service"" number could help. My son stood at Air India ticket counter trying to get someone to help with no luck kept telling him to come back in an hour. He is now in Dubai and we need to start process all over again. I will likely have to buy another ticket to get him home and we have already figured he will likely never see his luggage again. Nobody is willing to take responsibility for ensuring you actually get a flight that was already paid for.

air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,Vicki Tennant,Australia,2013-11-20,As a frequent traveller to India I really wanted to like Air India. Their new service to Australia would suit me perfectly. However apart from the lovely Dreamliner plane (on 3 legs of Sydney - Bangalore return) I would find it impossible to choose to fly Air India again. My flight was 2 hours late leaving Sydney which resulted in missing the Bangalore connection from Delhi. The was no information re the delay in Sydney and that was the start of us passengers being treated really badly. Because of the delay many passengers had to stay overnight in Delhi. Again no information until we got to the baggage carousel. I missed morning appointments in Bangalore etc. Delays are common - speaking to passengers on my return trip their flight out of Sydney was 8 hours. If you have an onward trip from Delhi avoid Air India at all costs. The cabin staff service was variable - some were ok others had a really surly attitude. The ground staff were terrible rude without exception. The lounge in Delhi (which you would expect to be Air India's flagship lounge) was mediocre - wifi 'not working' showers 'not working' food/drinks not worth having.

MAA-SIN No boarding pass from MAA-SIN and no visa for India meant we spent 60 minutes of stress in no-man's- land while an AI staff went to get us boarding passes and clear our luggage through Chennai customs. Chennai business lounge in old terminal was shocking. Wanted to charge for drinks after the first freebie. Eventually got away to SIN on an A330 which was ok - 6.5/10. Would recommend the 787s but not much else even though I got a bargain price in business class. Dreamilners were beautiful the rest was so so.,,,Business Class,,7.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4.0,0

But some passengers screens weren't working.

When they announced that passengers with children plus first and business class passengers could start boarding about 300 people all got up and jammed the departure point! On board the crew were very efficient helpful and friendly. Very spacious seats although slightly uncomfortable when they are fully reclined.

I am an Air India loyalist but I mostly fly them within India wherein I find their service quite good. There is a marked difference while flying them International. They use an A319 on their DEL-SIN route which is generally packed to capacity. Luckily I got upgraded however their business class seat is very poor. The recline is as much as that of their economy class seat and most foot rests were broken. There were PTVs but nothing was playing not even a flight plan. There was a snack served at take off (midnight departure hence I refused) which was the end of any service for the rest of the flight. A cup of tea had to be asked for before arrival at Changi. SIN-MAA on a tired A330-200. Flight absolutely packed. Service was quick and efficient with dinner served however I was very surprised that their bar only had beer or whiskey not even wine. Over head TVs showing a Bollywood movie with subtitles but terrible picture quality like they were running a pirated movie. Fares are cheap and you do get what you pay for.

Online check in was therefore not possible for me. My seat area also wasn't up to Western standards of cleanliness. There is no menu for food. 'Continental chicken Indian lamb or Indian vegetarian' isn't really enough info. Drinks selection is very limited. Only one beer choice only 4 spirits (no rum). Entertainment: Of the 10 buttons on my console 5 were ripped out and so using the console was tricky. TV selection doesn't exist at all if your language is English movie selection is very limited.

The cabin seating is 2x3x2 unlike most carriers which have 2x4x2 on 777s so seats are comfortable and wide. Crew were happy to make fresh pots of coffee and tea and serve with a smile. The food is rather decent if you like a curry. Great planes clean toilets excellent service tasty food and a more than competitive pricing.

Other than being served on china the meals were economy class standard complete with clingfilm wrap and yoghurt that was 4 days past its sell by date. There were 4 or 5 English- language movies in total but the TV choice was extremely poor - only Hindi language.

The planes are cramped and uncomfortable the seat booking arrangements are chaotic and staff seemed unable or unwilling to explain what the problems were. We had problems both on the outwards and return trips. I had pre-booked seats online - do not do this as it causes all sorts of problems which the airport systems seem unable to override. For example when we asked to change to extra legroom seats at the airport in Kathmandu - we were given a boarding card for the Delhi-London flight but in fact our seats had been cancelled - as we discovered when we came to board. We were bumped off the flight and forced to spend a night in transit hotel limbo.

All flights departed on time. The seats could have been more comfortable but a cushion between the back and the seat took care of that. The bottom line is that the flights were at least £150 cheaper than the nearest rival and so if considered as a budget airline (the long haul Easyjet) I have no real complaints. My main gripe was the attitude of the cabin crew. They were really quite unfriendly smiles never quite made it to eyes - when I was up stretching my legs during the flight I was asked quite abruptly 'where are you going'?

Our buggy ended up on the belt in Delhi while we were in transit. Took us 90 minutes and a lot of frustration to find someone who could take the thing off and hand it over to us. Because of delay and short connection time the transit through the DEL airport was awful. Crew just dropped us of at the security check in the transit area and left us there. So collecting the transit passengers made no sense at all. The plane (B777-300ER ) was worn out and looked very tired. Our seats were very hard and uncomfortable. Meals were tasty but portions limited. No bread served. Only after take off a round with drinks was served. Once they served the food the crew disappeared and never came around again.

The dinner on the BOM-DEL sector was actually very good in Economy.

Left on January 22 and returned on January 30 on Boeing 777-300ER. Our seats were very hard and uncomfortable my backrest evidently lost it's memory and refused to stay in the upright position front seat pocket was partially glued together with a disgustingly big wad of chewing gum the inner plastic window insert kept rattling in unison with the jet engines.

air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,Gaurav Nerkar,India,2013-02-27,BOM-DXB-BOM Airbus 320 both ways with 3x3 configuration. Contrary to previous reviews I really like this product. The leg space was superb outbound flight left on time food adequate and filling. IFE selection was limited. FAs were nice and helpful. Inbound flight was redeye. Delayed by 1 hr and reached BOM late. Again food was delicious and same IFE with same movies. Check in smooth in DXB but in BOM a bad experience. I was travelling with my parents and unfortunately even after repeated requests we were given seats separately.

The transit/immigration through the new DEL airport was smooth. AI faced major delays on my return leg due to computer error at DEL and I ended up spending my time enjoying the new DEL T-3. The cabin crew kept an astounding service quality before the aggressive demanding passengers on board which made the journey memorable.

air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,A Cooper,United Kingdom,2013-01-10,23 December from LHR to Mumbai on the dreamliner. Plane itself was nice and the food and entertainment was fine although not much in the way of films/games for children. Luckily we had done online check-in for the connecting flight to Delhi as well. I handed in my luggage at the international terminal in Mumbai but this was not on the flight. After numerous telephone calls the luggage arrived on 26. Flight from Delhi to Chandigarh took off despite the pilot telling us there would be little chance of the fog clearing which meant that we circled above Chandigarh 4 times before returning to Delhi. Chaos on arrival and were it not for 2 helpful passengers things could have been a nightmare as no onward transport had been planned. It eventually left in the form of a coach 2-3 hrs later. For international flights AI is good but for domestic flights it is chaotic and staff are very unorganised. I would avoid Delhi airport if possible.,,,Economy,,7.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,4.0,1

While checking in at Chennai was told I was checked through all the way to Newark. Chennai to Mumbai delayed an hour - reached Mumbai close to midnight - still had an hour to catch the flight to Newark - mysteriously without any reason baggage was offloaded at Mumbai had to go through security again at the domestic airport waited for an hour for a bus to take us to the international airport to be told that we had missed our flight. Air India staff were extremely rude and they had no intention of getting us on another airplane. After a lot of arguments I was put on a flight to London and then on to Newark - lost a whole day.

Plane was a new 777 and seats were very comfortable with a lot of legroom. The inflight entertainment had a good choice of English and Indian films. My only gripe is the lack of an Air India lounge for Business Class passengers at IGI airport in Delhi. It's unacceptable to send your premium passengers to a regular cafe with poor quality food and no WiFi where the staff are trying to charge you for anything they can get away with. Please Air India stop using Cafes at IGI and get yourselves a proper business class lounge with WiFi decent food and drink.,,,Business Class,,8.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4.0,1

The seats are old and not that comfortable - leg room is ok though. Service from the cabin crew - nothing to get excited about either. They were quite stoic did their basic job and then sat (slept) on the forward jumpseat the rest of the flight. There was a breakfast service (the food was not bad) but they never came through an offered anything else - - nothing. The economy class had a second beverage service - but if you wanted something extra in business class - you had to ring your call button and then they would reluctantly come out of the galley. The inflight entertainment is very basic too - all Indian movies.,,,Business Class,,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,2.0,0

Flights were cheap and therefore I agree that they were value for money. Most of the inflight entertainment didn't seem to work across the cabin or the films packed up. The seats were possibly the most uncomfortable I have encountered they were narrow and the cushions non existent and the toilets smelt. The crew were friendly and attentive on the way out but appeared infrequently on the way back. Food on both flights was horrible.

Told they couldn't move us despite there being empty seats in business class. After a great deal of fuss we were moved forward. What a mistake - should have stayed in economy where the seats at least had a bit of padding and the service must have been better. No food served to anyone in business class but I assume you could have asked for it. Drinks offered once by a hostess that had difficulty with English so a red wine became a straight whiskey. After serving this the hostess and the cabin manager went to sleep in their chairs behind the curtain. In 40 years of travelling extensively this had to be the worse experience of any flight for comfort and service.,,,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,0

Flight was inbound from Seoul and even though we saw the plane for 2 hours + at the gate we were still late. Security boarding was extensive and a joke. Seat was broken but was found another. Flight attendants were grumpy. When we finally took off bar service started with tray table unceremoniously taken out in front of you with a bang. You had to have a drink no question. Then the food came. Was told prawn curry or vegetarian. No menu. No choice. It all came on 1 tray. Flight had not been provisioned correctly so 1/3 of business class got economy meals. Seat went back all the way to horizontal so I slept but cabin was freezing. Arrived in Delhi late. Disembarking the galley floors were flooded/cluttered which was awful. Transfer to connecting flight was badly handled. AVOD was a joke. It was very complicated and a choice of all of 4 new films.,,,Business Class,,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,0

Once onboard I found that no IFE available in this 5-hour flight so passengers were left without any entertainment except magazines and newspapers. Cabin crews were efficient however did not seem enthusiastic in interacting with passengers and hardly smiled. Call button answered promptly. My non vegetarian breakfast was tasty the crews performed one round of drinks after the meal and also one more prior to landing.

All flights on time check-in and embarkation monitored by cabin crews. All aircraft's clean modern and comfortable. Thanks to thin backseats the pitch seems larger than usual and to add to feeling of comfort the seats are equipped with footrests. Special mention to the Dreamliner brand new aircraft and serving several domestic destinations before entering service on international lines. The 'magic' stops here. No announcement given by captains. Average service from aircrews keeping a correct attitude and acting professionally. Food is below average both in quality and presentation. No menu given and on each flight almost the same choice of main course is proposed: vegetables or chicken with rice. Breakfast is very basic. All meals served in low quality plastic even picnic cutlery on long-haul you are afraid to break while using! Drinks are served before meals but take care as no drinks are served with meals (a mini bottle of mineral water comes in your plastic tray). AVOD delivers a basic but correct selection of classic and more recent movies Hollywood and Bollywood. All in all the AI product is simple the service minimum while acceptable as prices are on the low side. The food should really be improved and is not at the level one can expect from a flag carrier.,,,Economy,,5.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,3.0,1

An unaccommodating seat in a dated (if less than half-full) A320 was only marginally less disappointing than a breakfast service at which I was offered Fanta owing to a lack of regular juices. Given the low occupancy rate one might have expected service to have been more prompt and attentive. Instead the boisterous cabin crew decided to occupy the empty rows towards the rear and chatter amongst themselves while the passengers were left without IFE in a dimmed cabin.

First leg of the trip was a 4.5hour journey to Delhi and was the worst flight I have taken. After sitting down I realised my TV was not working I asked the flight attendant if this would rectify itself on take off and he told me to 'sit down and wait'. After take off my TV started up and I could only watch one English film which was half way through probably from the flight before. We landed in Delhi and after two hours boarded a better plane with bigger seats and bigger TV screens. The inflight entertainment was average but I could cope with that rude and lazy flight attendants I cannot. Not long after take off the trays of food come round. The curry was really nice shame the lady serving me was the complete opposite. After my meal I waited 20 minutes for a flight attendant when I wanted a drink after another 10-20minutes I got up and went to ask for a red wine. Who pays £700 for a long haul flight and has to serve themselves? The remainder of the flight was the same. 9.5hours with no flight attendants no-one answering the flight attendant button.

The staff even though well meaning are not interested. They simply did their three rounds (1 round of drinks and 2 of meals) and no more. On both flights the service call bell was not attended to even though I must have pressed it for at least 10 mins before giving up and getting up! On the LHR-DEL flight I did not complain about it but when I enquired on the DEL-LHR flight about why they did not attend to the service call they could not find it on the system.

But even the return flight was good and this time I had a ghastly middle seat. Nevertheless the staff kept up well- fed and hydrated; there was an ample supply of cookies/chips/drinks in the galley and the flight was quite pleasant.

Naturally comfort factor comes down to zero. No IFE and almost nil leg space. Seats are cramped and offer almost no push back. Meals were served well and decent keeping in mind that airlines in India are all trying to do away with the catering concept entirely. The ticket prices are quite stiff for this route and yet there is no business class on this aircraft. Its a small plane that can accommodate only 70 passengers.

LHR-DEL 777 had tired seats with ironmongery sticking into my back but seats are spacious and many were unoccupied so plenty of room. Inflight entertainment - seat-back screens worked intermittently and the neighbouring seat had buttons missing from the controller. Choice of non-Indian movies very limited anyway. Plane held at the gate for about an hour after 21.30 scheduled departure and no attempt made to serve drinks. Drinks eventually served 2 hrs 40mins into the flight. No wine with the meal. Chicken curry was excessively greasy. Breakfast coming into DEL was also poor. Indian airports offer tediously repetitive security checks at different points and DEL-BKK was delayed 1 hr 20mins. After boarding we waited at the gate for another 40 mins whilst passengers from a delayed flight straggled on. The Airbus looked pretty tired but seats were more comfortable again not overly busy and service was somewhat better on this flight with water offered frequently. Drink service was limited again. Dinner was better quality than LHR and tasty but tiny portions were disappointing. They didn't seem to make up any time on this flight so although I'd allowed 3 hrs for my transfer to domestic in BKK I missed my connection. Timekeeping was consistently poor DEL is a series of queues cabin service was disinterested the planes are relatively new but shabby food and entertainment lacking - and the tickets are expensive.,,,Economy,,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,0

The AVOD was a joke too many freeze ups. The 2 hour layover in FRA was almost necessary for stretching and walking around a little bit. BOM-ORD was about the same the only difference being the cabin crew were smiling a little more. BOM-MAA was a red-eye on an Airbus 319 but they still served a light dinner which was nice after a 3 hour layover in BOM. Ground staff in BOM and MAA were courteous despite the time of night at 1 am and 3 am respectively. The return MAA-BOM was an evening flight and the food was slightly better as it was a full dinner but had to circle over BOM for an hour following a runway intrusion.

We're spoilt for choice in Perth with multiple flights daily by AirAsia, Garuda, Jetsar and Virgin. We used to fly Jetstar because as a Qantas Club member we could use the QF lounge in Perth - that doesn't open just for Jetstar flights, so you have to jag it when there's a Qantas international flight going out - not that there's many of those these days. So this time we decided to give Air Asia a go because their fares were excellent. Spot on time departure ex Perth, clean aircraft and we paid extra for Row 1. Pleasant enough flight for a LCC. We paid extra for the Red Carpet service on the return journey, and this was an absolute treat. No queues, someone to escort you through immigration, and access to the Premier Lounge which is on a par with the QF Business lounges in Perth. Also you get to board first, so minimal queuing - for frequent travellers to Bali this is worth paying for. The usual customer types on board making it mildly embarrassing for the FA's but they'd be used to it on that run. It was an on time departure, and this time a little IFE with one of the cabin crew playing his guitar and singing over the cabin PA to well deserved applause from the punters. AirAsia is cheap as chips and very efficient - what's not to like on this easy 3.5  hour run between Perth and Bali. ",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy,Perth to Denpasar,8.0,3.0,4.0,,,4.0,,5.0,1

We boarded the flight which was scheduled to depart at 5.25 pm but due to some technical reasons they returned from the runway and had to change the plane at the last moment. As a result the flight got delayed by almost 3 hours. Next surprise was that they did not offer complementary food considering everybody was just sitting in the plane for 3 hours. When some of us asked the reply was that they are not carrying sufficient food for everyone. The crew was inexperienced. They had no idea about how to handle the situation.

The first five rows are reserved for anyone who buys the premium seats (I think it cost about 10 bucks) and they were mostly empty on both flights so I was able to lay down and sleep across the second row.

At about 10.30am we were told the flight would leave 2.5 hours late. (We didn't board until after 3pm). Many of us would miss connecting flights I was told that I would be informed about my new connection in Kuala Lumpur. We arrived just after 9pm we handed our boarding passes and were told to wait. After an hour we were given boarding passes for our next flights and were told we had to collect our baggage to go to a hotel. We waited for an hour with our luggage then went through immigration and customs and left the airport to wait for a bus to our hotel. After midnight some of us started to realise that the promised hotel rooms were non-existent and went inside to be in the air conditioning. (We hadn't had food or water served for about five hours by this time.) One staff member yelled at people who were reluctant to leave again to wait for the hotel bus and security were called when one passenger started to complain loudly. A group of passengers were taken to a hotel and returned to our group outside the airport after an hour because they couldn't get them rooms. AirAsia staff then left us. I for example waited 12 hours outside the airport with all my luggage; I had no Malaysian currency to buy food because I was only in transit. No one offered me a food or drink voucher and not one AirAsia staff member apologised. Apparently this level of service is acceptable.

I generally found them to be a value airline but my opinion is changing. I flew from HoChiMinhCity to Kuala Lumpur return. As with most discount airlines the ""all in price"" listed in the booking is hard to find. First of all you have to wade through the various ad-ons for baggage insurance etc deducting them as you go or you end up with an inflated fare. But to my surprise as I hadn't experienced this gouge before the booking imposed a $12 fee for using my credit card. As well the onboard duty free sales do not take credit cards only Malaysian currency and US dollars despite stating that all major currencies were accepted. My seat-mate on the inbound flight had to convince staff to accept Euros. All in all after all costs were added up the flight was only marginally cheaper than Vietnam Airlines and far less hassle with a full service carrier. Air Asia advertises low-cost but their fares have risen dramatically in the past few years. I don't think the average customer wants to have to spend time and energy having to find the ""all in price"" deducting the various ad-ons only to be stung at the end with the credit card charge. By then you are so fed up with the search for the initial fare that you just agree to pay the ""fine"" for using your credit card. In my caes it amounted to a surcharge of about 15%. The credit card companies charge their customers 3%. Flying discount airlines can be the only reasonable cost way to fly to some destinations.

As a result she had to travel through KL and this added an extra 8 hours to her trip. They promised that the issue of the direct flight would be fixed before her return trip and guess what. Another text two days before she returns home saying that she is going through KL again. Then the morning of coming home the Flight to KL was cancelled and she was put on an earlier flight meaning she had to leave her hotel in a mad rush at 4am to get to the airport.

airasia,/airline-reviews/airasia,AirAsia customer review,Brian W Fisher,United Kingdom,2014-12-10,I needed to get to Bangkok Chiang Mai and Krabi. To do this within my allotted time span I had no alternative but to fly between these cities. The price differential is quite marked so I elected to try Air Asia which would allow me to compare it with Bangkok Airways who I had flown with before. The aircraft was configured as a single cabin. The first few rows sported cotton covers over the seat headrest and were reserved for passengers willing to pay a premium. The other seats were so close together that for any person over five feet six inches (like myself) were forced into a painful contortion to avoid digging their knees into the seat-back in front. Minutes after the aircraft departed the four cabin crew members wasted no time in blocking the aisles with trolleys flogging drinks and snacks followed quickly by the same four trying their best to get passengers to buy mementoes of Air Asia. My next flight (Chiang Mai to Krabi) due to depart at 12 noon was cancelled. Its replacement was rescheduled to depart at 5.30pm. This meant a totally wasted day for me and meant arriving at my pre-booked hotel at 9pm instead of 3pm. No apologies – no explanations from Air Asia. The only consistency being the aircraft seating configurations and 2 hours of discomfort instead of one. More of the same on my last flight so there is little point in relating it. All in all my experiences were certainly negative ones.,,,Economy,,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,0

A320 arrived late but plane was turned around quicker than normal. Gate agents never said anything about the delay which I hate - just say the flight is late. We departed 20 minutes late and arrived in Siem Reap about 10 minutes late. Short 50 minute flight. Plenty of leg room (I'm 175 cm) and had a seat in the middle open so plenty of room. Flight attendants very friendly. Didn't eat or drink but snacks looked reasonably priced. Luggage was off quickly - immigration took forever but that isn't Air Asia's fault.

Agents were friendly both on the ground and in the air. Inbound flight was late an hour so departure was delayed the same time ground staff announced the delay just at the time we would have been departing. Think its a standard of Air Asia to not announce delays promptly. Flight was good - 2 hours and again a seat in the middle free. Bought noodles and snacks - good value for money and delicious.

airasia,/airline-reviews/airasia,AirAsia customer review,D Van Hove,United States,2014-12-10,November 26th Chiang Mai to Hong Kong. Early morning flight (departure time 06.00) and while the standard check- in for international flights is 3 hours prior to departure time the counter failed to be staffed until 04.20. A small irritant yes but it was a harbinger of things to come. Ticketing and luggage handling pretty typical of any other airlines with the exception of dealing with excess baggage. Each bag is weighed and there is no leeway whatsoever. Every increment of one kilo was billed as excess baggage. They do not make this easy. The passenger must leave the queue walk across the terminal to the Air Asia cashier process the necessary transaction and then return to the ticket agent to complete the process. We knew we had excess weight we had pre-purchased an additional 20 kilos of sporting equipment. The agent unilaterally decided that trekking equipment was not sporting equipment therefore it was to be classified as excess baggage. We were forced to pay an additional 5575 baht (approximately 175.00 USD) simply based on his arbitrary determination. We pre-ordered and prepaid for an inflight meal. Their idea of a breakfast meal is a small tin of rice or noodles and a 4 oz. cup of water. It was the worst attempt at a meal I have ever witnessed. On this trip we used 10 different airlines. Did Air Asia get us to Hong Kong on time? Yes. Was the plane clean? Yes. Did we receive value for the money spent? Not even close. Of all the airline companies we flew was AirAsia at least average? Not even close! Would we ever fly this company again knowing now how they treat their customers? I hope we never are faced with that decision.,,,Economy,,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,0

Our expectations were kept at a reasonable level and once again we were not disappointed. Cabin service was good. I have found AA and AAX cabin staff to be at least as good as those of full-service airlines but some of the ground staff at the old LCCT and on the Gold Coast have been abrupt if now downright rude. A few ground staff at the old LCCT had a poor command of English.

This is the third airline review I am adding - the previous two I have literally just submitted using a 'minus points plus points' format. I'm not sure that I can think of any minus points for this flight. There was nothing amazing about it but it ticked the boxes that this low-cost airline pledged to tick. I have scored 3/5 for ""Food and Beverages"" because I am required to score but I did not have any as I chose to bring my own on-board.

Coming back things were less hectic as it was a normal weekday. I chose a lunch time flight so we could use a taxi to the airport easily. Check in was quick and the flight went on time. The pre-booked meals were all as expected. Seats were free up the back and we were allowed to use them and spread out. Arrival at KLIA2 was easy as we'd used the airport before.

We were very pleasantly surprised at the amount of space and the ability to turn the seat into an almost flat bed albeit the incline was just enough to make sliding down the seat a bit of a problem. The service was excellent and whilst the food was quite basic and they had not got our pre ordered meals correct the food was adequate. The inflight entertainment was also quite basic but as we had been warned of this we had our own tablets etc so we certainly did not suffer.

Cabin consists of 12 seats only so is nice and quiet.

Nice big pillows and doonas complete the feeling of luxury. Meals are not a highlight however. We find comfort far more important than meals. One good thing about the meal service however is you can tell the cabin crew when you would like to eat. If you want a comfortable few hours sleep where you can stretch full length and cuddle up in a doona can thoroughly recommend Air Asia Business Class.

We made our meal selection at the time of booking. We were given a glass of orange juice on arrival and the meals we had selected were delivered soon after take-off. These are normal economy fare but at the fare we paid we did not expect any different. Alcohol was available for payment. The seats however are as good as you would hope to find in any full service business class. Fully lie flat and with the full size pillow and duvet supplied we enjoyed a good sleep for almost the entire flight. Would I chose this again?

I had already booked a flight from BKK to SYD on another airline but had to cancel and find another flight closer to my departure date. AirAsia had a business class ticket available departing from Don Mueang at an excellent price so I bought it. The first flight from DMK to KUL didn't have a designated business class seating section but my seat was in the 3rd row so that was convenient. The flight from KUL to SYD did have a separate business class seating area with chairs that reclined almost flat for sleeping. The chair width was ample. Although a 180 degree flatbed would have been better AirAsia's was decent and I was able to sleep fairly well. The service was excellent and we were given extra snack treats.

On the way back they managed to put our 2 children (5 and 8 years old) in row 6 and the parents in row 26.

We checked in several hours before our flight and were disappointed to find that we had been given seats in two different rows (my husband and I were flying with our two kids). Obviously we had hoped to sit together as a family but thought ""oh well it's not the end of the world"". We boarded the plane and realised that we were not only in different rows but in 4 different seats. We were absolutely gob-smacked that an airline could put a 2 year old on his own! When we waved down the air hostess and explained that our son who had just turned two could not sit on his own she told us that the flight was full and we would have to take our dedicated seats. I told her that our 2 year old could not possibly sit on his own and she suggested that he sit on my lap instead. Pretty disappointing when you paid for 4 seats. Just when I thought things couldn't get much worse the food trolley came around and after placing my order for a hot meal for myself and my two kids I was told that they only accept cash and not card. I didn't have any cash on me (I had actually tried to withdraw cash at the airport but the ATM was out of order) so they told me I was unable to order any food. I said that there must be some other option as my kids were hungry and surely there was something they could do but they did not help at all. My poor kids basically spent the whole flight crying with hunger and they wouldn't even give me a bottle of water (as our water had been taken off us at the airport by security). I was basically in tears by this time and finally a kind passenger gave me $10 so I could buy something for the kids to eat.

I have flown with them for 7 years and I'm losing patience at the way they do not care for passengers who support them. They are not cheap anymore.

airasia,/airline-reviews/airasia,AirAsia customer review,Erwin Leonardi,Singapore,2014-09-17,Unpleasant Experience - flying with toddler with Air Asia. I flew with my wife and 4-year-old son from Jakarta to Singapore on 12 Sep 2014. Surprisingly three of us were assigned to three different seats in three different rows. I asked the check-in counter officer to change the seats. However he said that the flight was full and suggested I purchase seats in advance on my next flights. Some thoughts on this incident: 1) Is this Air Asia business model? Separating a toddler from his/her parents could PUSH the parents to purchase seats on the next flight. This is shown as an ads on AirAsia magazine. 2) Is safety Air Asia's concern? Separating a toddler from his/her parents raises a safety risk. Suppose an emergency event occurs. Who will help the toddler? Do you think a stranger sitting next to him/her would help him/her? Finally I exchanged seats with other passengers. This definitely causes unpleasant for them. After this incident I do not recommend a family with young children to fly with Air Asia unless they want to purchase seats.,,,Economy,,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,,,4.0,0

I booked the Premium Flex fare to enjoy the extras such as 20kg checked baggage and priority seating. Online booking is straightforward if a bit annoying due to the many forced opt-out options one has to explicitly decline. Web check-in however started to be positively jarring: mobile boarding pass didn't work with a European cell number the airport kiosk can't reprint an already issued boarding pass and the whole experience gets very frustrating very soon. Ground staff were helpful but this is too little to overcome the system's shortcomings. Priority boarding is a myth at LOP as there is only a single security line at the gate which opened extremely late. That way everyone finds themselves standing in a long line with no seating while hundreds of empty seats wait inside the gate area. I ended up boarding among the last just to fight for some overhead bin space and reclaim my assigned seat. FAs didn't really seem very engaged and it took some doing to get their attention just to purchase a drink onboard.

Check-in for this flight was very good barely queued for 3 or so minutes before the airline's agents checked us in. Boarding for this flight was not as organised as I would have preferred. Firstly the airport mixed up the gates so there were a lot of confused passengers rushing to the correct gate. Secondly the gate agents did not issue PA announcements so many passengers quickly rushed to the front of the gate counter in the hope that they'll get to board first which shouldn't be the case for an airline that charges for priority boarding. Boarding was slightly delayed due to preparation of aircraft but the airline made up for the delay by boarding passengers through the front and rear exits. The flight departed Penang just a few minutes late once airborne the crew came around quickly to distribute immigration cards and take orders for drinks/deliver pre-booked meals. Aircraft was a bit worn and tired - my seat pocket was ripped on the left side and passenger in front of me seemed to have trouble reclining. Nevertheless seat was quite comfortable. Arrival in Singapore 10 minutes ahead of schedule and disembarked within 10 minutes of landing.

We boarded the airplane and just after the safety instructions we where informed that there was a problem with an engine. So we waited a further hour when we were informed that we had to disembark. So about 300 passengers left the airport received a coupon and started to queue at the 1 shop to get some food. After an hour of queuing the shop stopped serving claiming that they had run out of food and that we had to go to the other side of security zone to get some food. So we where directed to another queue which turned out to lead to a security check which took away all the fluids that we had bought and returned us exactly where we had started. We queued again to the shop. After an hour the police came and said we had to vacate the area. In both cases an Air Asia representative should have taken the trouble to inform us of what was going on. So then we had a further 3 queues each taking more than an our to pass passport control get hotel vouchers and board busses. Air Asia obviously does not care about our holiday time because if they had they would have canceled the flight earlier so that at least the passengers could spend an afternoon outside of the airport.

airasia,/airline-reviews/airasia,AirAsia customer review,Wai Kuen,Australia,2014-08-15,"Premium/Business class in the month of August KL - Seoul Busan - KL. Melb - KL Sydney - KL. Recently Air Asia tried to rename the premium class to business class. I found the word business class really misleading because it is not a business class yet premium seat is more like it. Well whatever name you call it you cannot only book the ""new business class"" to and from Kuala Lumpur. If you are flying out to and from any Malaysia small city you are blocked from booking the business class. The implication is that the passenger need to purchase multiple itineraries and no luggage check through to the final destination. Why is Air Asia doing this? It is very inconvenient for business man like us when we need to rush from one gate to another and what more to say rushing to collect luggage and check in again. Imagine with the new KLIA2. One has to be really fit to do the long walk and keep the figure cross that he/she can locate the other gate safely. I travel a lot in the ""old premium class"" sometimes it is value for money when it is on offer. There is not much service and no entertainment but it comes with free meals and luggage.

Arriving at the counter at 1.15pm I asked the counter if there was a delay in our flight I was told that there was no such delay for our flight and that our boarding time was at 2.30pm. 2.30pm came and went and there was no announcement made regarding our flight. There was no one at the AirAsia departure lounge counter so I went to the check in counter and asked staff what our flight status was. I was then informed that there would be announcements. 3.00pm - no announcements. 3.49pm still no announcements. 4.17pm no announcement. 4.28pm an announcement that our flight will be delayed 1 hour. 5.35pm an announcement that the plane will not arrive until 6.05pm. 6.08pm arrival of the plane. 6.35pm boarding. 7.00pm on the flight I asked the flight attendant for my pre purchased comfort kit and was informed that they did not have any on the flight. As you can imagine after spending over 3hours waiting for the flight and being told that my comfort kit was not available I was mighty ticked. I know that there are circumstances that flight will be delayed and I understand that but the lack of communication given to customers was poor. I had heard such good things regarding AirAsia but after this and the cancelation of our Clark to Kalibo flight on the 14th of November 2013 I will be very hesitant and wary of using AirAsia again.,,,Economy,,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,0

I am not a big person but these seats are very close! They do recline but not much. Not very comfortable for a long flight but for a short flight you can put up with it. The price was pretty reasonable. They do charge for everything though. I paid extra for a seat assignment one piece of luggage and a chicken dinner.

Checking their website this particular 0850 KUL departure for Perth no longer appears. So they have just cancelled the flight because the were not enough passengers. As a result instead of a 2 hour connection in KUL I now have an 18 hour connection at KUL. No compensation offered or even interest in the gross inconvenience to passengers who have booked and paid on the basis of a reasonable connection. What can one do for 18 hours with a 2 year old child at KUL? Their customer service is simply mealy mouthed excuses and the claim that a stopover hotel is 'not within their service recovery'.

We had checked in online so it was clear I wasn't pulling anyone's leg about trying to get things done on the website.

We have flown on airlines throughout the world and have never been on a worse airline in 50 years of flying. Kuala Lumpur airport is awful. When you ask if there are meals provided they say ""yes"" but don't tell you that you are required to pay extra. If you have cashed in your money because you are flying into another country you are out of luck. We were 6 hours without a coffee water or tea. When we asked for a complimentary coffee the flight attendant said ""No we are a low cost airline"". They nickel and dime you all the way. When you check in they ask if you would like to check your bag. Then hit you with a $30 charge! However they let all kinds of over-sized bags on the plane so getting to your seat is total chaos.

I must say that fares aren't that much cheaper than full service airlines if you only book a few weeks in advance. There are a lot of additional fees some of which are not avoidable. If you have to change your flight you will get clobbered. Check-in was another problem. Their website says that international check-in opens 3 hours before the flight - not true. The check-in did not open until 2 hours before. Once it did the queue did move at a painfully slow pace. The agent seem to have problems with every person checking in and had to call the supervisor over more than once for every passenger. I'd checked in online but not printed my boarding pass (as I had a mobile one sent to my mobile). This caused a lot of problems and needed the supervisor. Once through security everything was a breeze. Organised boarding great cabin crew clean plane comfortable seats and good food. I'd check to see how much you're actually saving before using Air Asia.

There was a lot of hassle and waiting but I was provided with my boarding pass. Flight was good aircraft could do with some updating but the flight was half empty which meant flat bed. Check in gave me a hot seat without paying for it. As soon as seat belt sign was off I went to sleep staff left me alone and it was all good. Cant comment on food or how the service was but as far as I am concerned in the air I got what I wanted. The selection of food is quite bland I would prefer to just take my food on board.

The legroom was also adequate. I'm 5'11"" (180 cm) and I had a small amount of space in between my knees and the seat in front of me. That being said for a long flight three hours plus it would get a bit tiring. I pre-ordered a meal which tasted fine. Unfortunately it was on a flight that was delayed for two hours and departed after Midnight and I had already eaten the same meal unknowingly twice before. Definitely wasn't in the mood.

Their services from ground to in-flight staff were inefficient. KOL-HKT 5 of us were travelling including my 2 year old daughter. Bangkok- Phuket being a short haul flight I skipped the seat selection (my biggest mistake). I told the lady at the check- in counter that we required 3 seats together minutes later our luggage was through and we were handed the boarding passes. All 5 of us were placed at different seats far from each other. Upon boarding I wasn't going to sit down until 3 of us were seated next to each other. A stewardess found 3 passengers who felt sorry for our situation and swapped seats. I saw their so called hot seats for which you pay extras for extra leg room were not any different from those ordinary seats. The seats were so cramped that you can hardly move if the seat in front was reclined back. Air Asia can change their flight timings anytime they want so stay tuned and updated. Our flight was postponed nearly 24 hrs.They claimed that they did try to contact me. At the sales desk we were told to wait an hour and see if there were any no shows. There were so we rushed to check-in luggage through and then told that there are only four seats left and we must hold the baby in our lap. We had no choice rushed to the aircraft as the last call was announced. We struggled just like before with the separated seats even though this time I had pre-selected seats with the original flight. We also had pre-booked meals with the original flight but since we boarded on a different flight they wouldn't serve us any meal. Air Asia in Bangkok lands at Don Muang Airport and not the Suvarnabhumi. The difference in two is that the Don Muang airport is an old airport and later is a new one.

airasia,/airline-reviews/airasia,AirAsia customer review,Rohit Thukral,United States,2013-10-25,I have traveled this airline twice. While their inflight service is average I found other aspects to be quite awful. I travel extensively across US Europe and Asia so have a good basis of comparison. If there is a problem - don't expect any competent problem solving. Ground staff are poorly trained and unhelpful in case of a problem. First time I traveled my flight from Phuket to Bangkok was delayed several hours and they had no idea when the flight was going to depart or even which gate it would depart from. On a recent flight from Siem Reap to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur several transit passengers had to be offloaded because they could not transit through KL - you need to enter the country and then exit via immigration so those from countries requiring visas were not able to board. They have no transit facilities at their hub in KL. The website clearly states they have through transit facilities - to this the passengers were told by the ground staff manager that the website is frequently incorrect and cannot be relied on. So that is the other problem - their website is unreliable and not kept current by their own admission. which in this day and age is totally unacceptable. Their terminal in KL is awful - it makes a Greyhound bus terminal seem sophisticated and comfortable. There is no place to sit and its bursting at the seams with passengers. If you have a long stopover be prepared to stand around or sit on the floor or on your bag. There is little to eat or drink until after you go past immigration to the gate but you can't check in to your flight until 2 hours before departure - so if you have a long break between flights you better come equipped. I have taken my last flight on AirAsia - it is truly the worst airline I have flown.

SUB-KUL flight was pushed an hour early to 5.40am due to airport being overcrowded on Eidl Fitr holiday which was somewhat understandable. Having printed our boarding passes we still had to line up at the check in counter to pay airport tax. Once we arrived in KL we were ushered through the flight transfer area where staff informed us of our next departure gate and we had a pleasant 3 hour transit at the LCCT. Flights to and within Thailand were pleasant and punctual. Evening flight from Phuket to Chiang Mai they ran out of food by the time the crew got to our seats so we had instant noodles instead. In Chiang Mai we had to line up at the check in counter again to get a stamp in order to pass through the security check. We were rudely denied entry into the flight transfer area in KL on the way back to Surabaya because ""the flights were booked under different booking codes"". Note that there is no way to book AK and QZ flights under single purchase on the airline website and when we inquired the staff she mumbled something about ""not paying a transfer fee"" and us getting past the transfer hall last week was not meant to be part of procedure. We took our case to an immigration officer who accompanied us back to the transfer staff but turns out the immigration had to comply to airline policies. Begrudgingly we lined up at the long immigration lines to have our passports stamped entered the departure hall and lined up at the immigration again to find out that our flight was delayed 30 minutes.

Only downside is with all the space and empty jetways and stands why oh why bus people to the plane? With the hot seats you get to board first but boarding the bus first does not help as its still scramble on the plane. 2nd leg to Phuket again easy check in had 'normal' seats on plane and leg room is ok but I am not the tallest guy.

It supposed to be a good flight but due to a delay my flight departed in the evening and I was devoid of scenery as it was dark. Seat pitch was not great for a flight longer than one hour. I had a mixed feeling over the food. The fried rice was terrible but the satay was great.,,,Economy,,6.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,,,4.0,1
airasia,/airline-reviews/airasia,AirAsia customer review,Phil Malone,Thailand,2013-01-25,I am unhappy that Air Asia's transfer to Don Muang airport has not improved any of their problems they had when they used to fly from Bangkok's main airport at Suvanabumhi. The delays are the same - from the check in counters to the flight departures. Last week I waited 1 hour in the check in line - unacceptable when they are only 1 of 3 small airlines using this airport. Then you have to take a bus from the check in gate to where the plane is located almost a kilometre away on the tarmac. Changing from Bangkok's main airport was supposed to improve all these things. Also transferring from Don Muang to Survanabumhi (where all the other airlines leave from) takes a long taxi ride of around 600 baht (incl. 3 tolls). It is just not worth using Air Asia in Thailand at all! Their website often goes down during your flight booking and there is never any response when you make a customer complaint. This airline makes changes to suit itself and save money but never makes changes for its customers.,,,Economy,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,,,2.0,0

The satay chicken was quite oily however the tandoori chicken wraps were nice. Every flight was on-time if not early.

We had no problems with baggage and staff were not all that bad. I didn't like the fact that you had to pay extra for in- flight entertainment and had no screen on the back of the seat in front of you but that is common with most budget airlines.

However I was intrigued that each time we weighed in our bags on the Air Asia scales they were 1kg to 1.5 kg heavier than on Qantas or Thai scales - and we had exactly the same contents in them.

The seat's pitch is not a problem but the issue lies with the amount of shoulder space between passengers. There is just not enough space if you have broad shoulders. The seats are comfortable for smaller builds only. I had to lean on one side throughout my 8 hour flight. The poor quality padding starts to present itself about 2 hours into flight. The toilets are very clean. The sandwich taste good on both legs. The attendants are friendly but firm. I can see why it is the best low cost airline because it does offer the best value.

To give a refund is to shirk responsibility. Anyway I suppose low-cost travel is fine provided nothing goes wrong. If it does you're completely stuck at a foreign airport.

Air Asia is the usual low-cost routine - a separate terminal with no facilities bus out to the plane at the far end of the airport tight seating and generally a joyless experience. Since when did air travel become so bland and so unexciting? Our biggest disappointment was the Air Asia terminal/departure lounge at Narita airport. Once you enter after check-in you cannot leave and there are no facilities except a toilet and a small shop. We felt trapped and stuck there in a facility that resembles a hospital waiting room. This in a busy and interesting airport with an array of shops cafes etc but we were stuck in this waiting room with no forewarning and no way to leave. Anyone checking in 3 hours in advance as requested would be well advised to time it to the last minute before going through security as this departure lounge is a horrid experience. I would also add looking at the ticket prices which creep ever upwards that the only thing cheap about low-cost travel nowadays is the way you feel after using it.,,,Economy,,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,0

The flight eventually took off almost 2 hours late. Even though I had paid for a 'hot seat' the pitch is far from adequate and it wouldn't recline. Air Asia when they first started out were a good low cost airline and value for money but they have declined dramatically the prices have gone up and everything connected with the airline has gone down. I won't fly with them again!,,,Economy,,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,0

Aircraft's parked far away from our boarding gate. We walked more than 300 metres. Seat comfort and leg room are extremely poor. Staff were nice. However on our return trip from Hanoi a male crew was standing like a poster man. Neither instructed to ease the boarding flow nor helping a nanny who was holding her grandson to stow her hand luggage.

airasia,/airline-reviews/airasia,AirAsia customer review,C Chai,Malaysia,2012-07-09,The joy that was AirAsia 10 years ago when I started flying with them is no more! On my last flight the problems were so bad I'm convinced this is no longer the way for me to fly even if its on a budget airline. I've already checked in and only needed to arrive early at the airport and then drop my luggage. Unfortunately for me the AirAsia check in system was down. This resulted in very long queues and after 40 long and uncomfortable minutes they resorted to manually check-in passengers and their luggage. While all that is happening they constantly announced about the failure and asked for patience but they continued calling passengers to board flights as if everything else is working. By the time I heard the boarding announcement for my flight we were still hopelessly stuck in the queue. When I approached a ground staff I was horrified to find out that the flight was to take off as scheduled! After at least 1 hour+ of delays thanks to their own check in system's outage I had to remind AirAsia's ground staff that we weren't late because of our own doing. Finally after some frantic phone calls and after realizing at least 50% of the flight passengers are still stuck in queues waiting to check in or to drop their luggage they agreed to delay the flight by 1 hour. Also if you have to board or disembark in KL's LCCT terminal when it's raining I think you will feel very differently about AirAsia - the experience is nothing short of horrible for passengers.,,,Economy,,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,2.0,0

airasia,/airline-reviews/airasia,AirAsia customer review,B Lamprell,Vietnam,2012-07-02,We flew from SGN-BKK return in June 2012. I flew Air Asia ten years ago and found it was a fun inexpensive airline. How things have changed! It seems Air Asia is now all about squeezing as much money as possible out of the unsuspecting passenger. I can understand budget airlines charging more for the extra space of exit row seats but to charge you $11 extra because you have a medical condition that requires an aisle seat so you can walk during the flight or the same treatment to a passenger with motion-sickness being denied a window seat is a blatant rip-off. Your seat is selected randomly by a computer and if you don't like it then you pay $11 to change it. In Bangkok I tried to call Air Asia’s office 3 times but each call dropped out while I was waiting to speak to someone. The old 10kg baggage allowance has been reduced to 7 kg. (My carry-on wheeled backpack weighs 3kg) so that means I can pack not much more than my toiletries bag and a change of underwear before I exceed the weight limit. If you book on-line checked baggage fees and insurance are added unless you “uncheck” them. Boarding in BKK was a case of “first rush first aboard”. The flight itself was fine but the entire Air Asia experience leaves a lot to be desired.,,,Economy,,2.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,,,3.0,0

The staff at the check-in was busy talking among themselves while my flight is 40 minutes from departure. Went into waiting hall and straight directed to plane.

Every flight was great staff were friendly and basically you pay for what you get. If you fly a budget airline and pay minimal cost for your tickets expect this and no more. For me this is my preference. My only criticism is around the minimal options for food and after pre-booking inflight entertainment and paying for it - it not being available. I believe improvements can be made in this area. Otherwise the seats facilities service is great - expect to get what you pay for and you'll be more than happy.,,,Economy,,8.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,,,5.0,1

Outbound flight was delayed by more than an hour due to late arrival of the plane as well as technical issues. Return flight was more pleasant and arrived about 15 mins early. It would seem that AirAsia is now deliberately splitting up passengers and seating them separately in order to encourage them to pay extra for advance seat selection. I witnessed a passenger frantically trying to re-arrange seating onboard so that his companion could be seated with him. My own companion was also seated across the aisle but we were not too bothered by that.

The LCCT is getting a bit long in the tooth for the number of pax passing through but BKK immigration staff would do well to see how to handle pax properly and efficiently. I prepaid for a meal and found it to be very tasty indeed. Although they claim to have a no outside food policy onboard they don't implement this. Biggest problem with low cost carriers is the pax they carry.

While the bag drop was slow and the food not that good the service was fine as was the aircraft a fairly new looking A320-200. The seat was comfortable enough for a 2hr 20min flight! The flight arrived just about on time and I was through the low cost terminal in 20min; I picked a seat paid for a 25kg bag and had food.

Had a chair on the outward trip as far as the bus then left to struggle on and off the bus on my own and to climb up to the aircraft. At Penang Airport had chair but had to walk up 2 flights of steps. The return was not too bad till got to Bangkok - no chair waiting the air hostess tried to ring for a chair but nobody answered the phone. Had to walk whole way through the airport with great difficulty and then collect my luggage. By the time I got to arrivals to meet my daughter I could hardly walk and was in a great deal of pain.

On both flights ground staff did not give priority boarding to premium economy passengers - everyone just barged on to the aircraft without a care for anyone else. Space between aisles was much tighter than other airlines and the seats certainly seem to be less roomier. Like a previous reviewer if you are going to have rules about luggage you must be prepared to enforce them! We had originally booked flights leaving Perth mid-afternoon and today I was informed by email that the flight had now been cancelled and we have been moved to an 8 pm flight.

All flights comfortable and with one exception on time. Air Asia's offer is basic but good. The seats are reasonably comfortable and better than many budget airlines. Having flown Air Asia for many years I notice the staff are not as enthusiastic as in the early days nor do they have time to interact with passengers. I wish the company would enforce their 'one carry-on bag' policy. Some passengers on one flight had up to four large bags.

Load only 50%. No IFE. FA inexperienced fairly professional but without personality. Food purchased in advance was very disappointing (both ways) and just in foil with a spoon absolutely nothing else not even salt. Food expensive for nothing. Biggest minus is the hassle with transfers where one has to vacate and re- enter the airport to sort baggage custom and immigrations for onwards travels. The airline tolerates mostly 2 pieces of hand-luggage. Inscribed luggage charged overweight if more than 1-2 kg. When purchase ticket one has to be careful not to be trapped purchasing expensive seating and superfluous insurance.,,,Economy,,6.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,,,4.0,1

Since Air Asia introduced web check-in the problem has started. My flight was to Chennai I did web check-in and arrived 2.5 hours early for baggage drop off. However the baggage drop off area was total chaos! People were cutting in between the lines without any respect for the queue. I waited in line for almost 2 hours without moving. 40 mins before departure two new counters opened for Chennai only and I managed to get my luggage dropped off 20 mins before departure. Ran for immigration but my expatriate gold card helped me pass through quickly and I boarded the flight 5 mins before departure.

There was no Baggage Drop-Off counter for passengers who took the time to check-in online - even their self-check- in facility was out of order! I queued for 40 minutes. Not providing the facility at CNX whilst promoting its use is unreasonable and irrational. Besides this aspect of their service this flight and the previous five with Air Asia have been similarly delayed. Don't be taken in with the price sometimes it is cheaper to fly TG.

Though notification of successful upgrade only came through via email some 8 hours before the flight. Not best but for the low price it was worth it. 14 hrs flight to LGW was fine. Food-wise there is just one main dish item for each meal service ie. no starters bread or desserts. A free bottle of water was provided with each meal (part of the Premium deal). Other soft drinks were chargeable. Not a problem if one manages one's expectations and prepares ahead accordingly. The Premium seat does indeed fold out flat but not horizontally. It tilts at an angle with head higher than the feet. It was comfortable enough and roomy. Almost full size pillows and light quilts were provided which was excellent. It was well worth getting upgraded this way (on standby via Optiontown). The total cost of the one way ticket was less than some one-way economy tickets within Europe! The entertainment console which cost RM 35 was okay. It had 6 films or so on it and some other TV programs and music. Crew were efficient. Commended. Baggage arrived fine.

My flight to SIN was slightly early but the return was almost 30 mins early into CNX arriving at 2235 instead of 2300. Boarding in SIN aided this and the aircraft with 55 pax pushed back 10 mins ahead of schedule but we lost that time waiting for a slot at the end of the runway! As per usual I ate at Changi and filled my water bottle from a fountain at the gate. 30 baht for their tiny bottle of water is a rip off. Looks like TAA is eating into Silkair's customer base as the latter has dropped its prices to about 1000 baht more than TAA but them there are no add ons and you get a free meal and beer.

I used this service on day one in January and hoped that they could at least get it back to CNX on time. The flight has been retimed since earlier in the year and it seems to work as the flight got into CNX 30 minutes early (as opposed to 30 mins late in January). I ate at Changi airport avoiding having to buy their overpriced meals onboard. As is usual with Air Asia the flights are pretty routine and uneventful. The check in kiosks make life very easy when having no baggage and I was able to check-in well ahead of regulation time. Thai crew were polite and efficient and I noticed that the first officer was a woman (a first for TAA?). Don't see many of them in Asia!! I'm slowly coming round to the fact that if needs must then Air Asia is a viable option provided you shop around and don't just assume that they are the cheapest because they say they are. Disappointed to see that the fuel surcharge is back for my June trip to Singapore! The other problem I have with them is that in allowing 'everyone to now fly' they allow people to do so who frankly shouldn't be allowed out of their living rooms and have no idea of how to behave when travelling or worst of all why the crew handed out immigration cards before landing.,,,Economy,,9.0,,,,,,,4.0,1

To say it was just another flight would be an understatement. And it was 30 minutes late which is about par for the course with Thai AirAsia. No apology for being late. Their slogan is 'newest planes newest routes'. Well it wasn't their newest plane which was delivered in time for the start-up of the SIN service. Judging by the crowds assembled in SIN for the return journey it looks like they are marketing the flight at the SIN end. There was no hype at CNX and I haven't seen any media coverage of the fact that the flight has now started. Most of the passengers were non-Thai. Standard Air Asia service. I cant believe they charge 30 baht for a small bottle of bottle. If you get a promotional fare its good value otherwise shop around.

Attempting to check-in with a mobile proved both costly and fruitless until the day I was actually due to depart. I visited the Air Asia office on Thaweewong Road Patong a few days prior to departure and was informed that there had been a bomb scare at their offices which had negatively impacted their booking system but I didn't find anything on local news media to substantiate that claim. When I eventually did get the 2D barcode image on my mobile Air Asia's scanners at Phuket International appeared unable to read it. Fortunately there wasn't a queue at the Web Check-in desk and they were able to print the boarding pass for me instead. The flight departed 50 mins late but I had allowed ample time to my connecting flight to Dubai. But I would advise anyone proposing to fly with Air Asia where there is a connecting international flight to consider to allow ample time because flight delays and even cancellations are the order of the day on Thai Air Asia. On arrival at BKK a further delay of about 45 mins occurred because as I was informed by an airport employee Air Asia didn't have any staff to offload the luggage from the plane.

The return ticket cost around USD100 (promo fare) including add-ons and extras. Excellent value for money. The problem with Air Asia seems to be actually managing to get these promo fares.

There were just two of us so everyone else piled on which meant we were actually one of the last on to the aircraft. The other is the price of the soft drinks which are frankly a rip-off.

Flights were all on time or within a few minutes of it, aircraft were spotlessly clean and even though the seat pitch is average for LCC at 29"", the seats are reasonably comfortable thanks to an intelligent slimline design - others could learn from this. Staff were friendly and professional throughout. In-flight food is purchase-only and expensive by Indian standards (although they will provide free drinking water) - a word of caution about pre-ordering, if you take up the 250Rs pre-paid option you could end up losing money, depending on your choice of food/drink. Also it appears they load up food and drink at the start of the day, and some options (e.g. Jaljeera juice) seem to consistently run out.

Low budget Airline - their fares are more or less the same if not more at times than full service carriers yet they continue to enjoy all the subsidies of a low budget airline. On time is a good thing - their flights are often now delayed or run late. Check-in process - everyone knows how long the queues are at the check in counters. Two days back on 4th June I did Web Check in for my 6th June flight using my smartphone. While I was successful in doing web check-in in spite of me giving the email address and phone no I did not get a copy of the boarding pass - beating the while process of doing Web check-in. At Delhi T1 terminal when I tried to print my boarding pass at the Check in Kiosk while it displayed the Boarding Pass I did not get my print out! On taking it up with the ground staff I got a casual reply - please stand in the queue even though I mentioned that the flight was due to board in next 35 minutes he simply refused to help me. As a result I reached the counter just 30 minutes before the departure of the flight and the check in lady commented ""Sir you are very late please be on time next time""!

After I had filled in all the passenger details I was asked whether I would like to take the pre-assigned seats facility and I declined and continued with my booking.

Finally they herded us in a bus that was then parked in front of the plane on the tarmac for 20 minutes while the incoming passengers disembarked. Needless to say we were packed like sardines and it was extremely hot. Also there was no step - senior citizens like myself cannot climb easily. I have reported this before but it has made no difference. At Lucknow despite there being aerobridges we had to get down in the sun at 2:30 pm and were again herded into a bus. I was reluctant to board as the bus was very full but was forced to climb in. Is it a problem to use the bus a second time or the aerobridge or maybe nobody cares? It was the same story on the way back on the 22nd of May for the 6.40 flight. We were again stuffed into two buses and had to risk falling on somebody's luggage because the insensitive staff did not care.

Had horrible experiences due to the fog. The outgoing flight was 4hrs late. You might think we were made to wait at the airport for this time but no we were boarded onto the aircraft bang on time and were made to wait there for over 4 hrs. That being said I agree this is no fault of the airline as the airport authorities force them to board the planes to decongest the terminal. Complimentary snack box and tea/coffee was provided. On the return flight( night time flight) we were diverted to Ahmedabad due to fog. This was totally acceptable but the events which followed made me doubt Indigo's reputation. We were not allocated a hotel for the next 5hrs. When we approached the assistants at Ahmedabad they kept telling us that a bus was being arranged. Finally at 3am they hired some taxis and took us to a decent hotel. No food or drinks was offered to us during the course of our wait and Ahmedabad airport is very poorly equipped with food stalls. We we're boarded onto a new flight the following day. Though diversions cannot be controlled by the airline the customer care can surely be looked into.,,,Economy,,6.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,,4.0,1

As far as I know and being travelled on other airlines for international trip. Shopping at Duty free is not considered as Hand baggage weight. Wait this is Indigo. You would find some one waiting at the boarding counter with weight machine. And charged me for the extra weight just for the shopping at Duty free. What more the person carries only manual slip. No credit cards accepted not even USD or INR (Globally accepted currency / Home currency). Had to go back to the currency counter to exchange. This was horrible experience had to shell out additional 1500 bucks (40 AED / Kg). Plus went inside and saw some seats at emergency exit were empty. Asked the cabin crew if I can sit at emergency exit as have some extra leg space answer I got was that I would have to pay extra if I want to sit.

However it took the airline 42 minutes to deliver baggage - first bag was delivered at 22.42 hrs! Bangalore Airport is very efficient and I have not experienced baggage delays in the past 3 years - both domestic and international flights. This delay was primarily due to inefficiency and bad co-ordination amongst the ground staff. Today IndiGo Airlines ground staff were pathetic and inactive - they repeated baggage will be on belt in 2 minutes while it actually took over 40 minutes. No supervisory staff were available to address the issue. Rain had stopped when this flight landed. Since this flight had no aerobridge facility we had to disembark from the flight - walk down an uncovered ramp into the bus. None of us were wet - but airline ground staff observed heavy rain to delay baggage delivery by 40 minute! Indigo Flight 6E 412 from Kochi to Bangalore landed at 22.06 hrs even this flight was late. But the last bag for this Indigo flight was on belt at 22.24 hrs. If the same airline can deliver bags for a flight that landed 4 minutes after the Mumbai-Bangalore flight how can they blame the weather system!

I am a frequent traveller from abroad and was on Goa - Ahmedabad flight on 27th February. It was 3.25pm but took off after 4.30. The onboard crew or flight deck crew were not bothered about other passengers. The passengers we waited for had booked 150 seats. I was sitting right in the front seat in row 1 so could hear what was said. There was no apology from the crew or cabin staff. When we landed at Ahmedabad airport we reported to the ground staff. We were asked to complain to the customer service knowing there will be no outcome. It was first time I had travelled Indigo who boast of their punctuality.

Both flights were slightly delayed (ca 15 mins) but the quality of the service has compensated for these minor delays. The planes are new offering ample legroom - on the flight back we were offered emergency exit seats with no extra fee- which was really nice of them. This flight is really short- ca 37 mins from take-off to touch-down so not much time to offer paid (or pre-paid) meals.

My printed ticket stated that I was allowed to carry one checked in bag of 15 Kgs one cabin bag of 7 Kgs and in addition a laptop bag. However during check in I was asked to weigh all three pieces (suitcase cabin bag and laptop) and was told that the cabin baggage allowance was only a total of 7 Kgs which includes laptop bag shopping bags and cabin bag. So please note that if you decide to travel with Indigo airlines you are only allowed one suitcase of 15Kgs and all your cabin bags (laptop shopping bags and cabin bag) should not exceed 7 Kgs.

indigo-airlines,/airline-reviews/indigo-airlines,IndiGo customer review,S Srinivasan,United States,2014-01-13,"MAA-DEL. It's been a few years since I've flown Indigo but for the most part their standards remain very good - easy check-in procedures helpful service with a smile both on the ground and in the air generally on-time clean planes and all for a good price. I decided to try the ""Fast Forward"" service which provides priority check-in and priority baggage delivery for 200 rupees per person. While the services were delivered as promised I found this to be an unnecessary expense as the regular check-in line was very short and baggage delivery in DEL is fast even without the priority tags. The seats however are rather hard and uncomfortable especially if you are trying to sleep. I don't think I'd want to sit in these for more than a couple of hours so consider this if you are considering trying their new international routes. Also they appear to have recently dropped their domestic baggage allowance from 20kg to 15kg per passenger. Excess baggage fees are reasonable if prepaid online but be aware of this especially if you are connecting to an onward international flight.",,,Economy,,8.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,,5.0,1

I bought a chicken sandwich for my son and it was awful! I usually fly Indigo Airline because of it's assurance of timely arrivals and departures. I've never had a reason to complain until my last experience. The flight was delayed. But the worst part was that the on board staff was inattentive and didn't even attempt to sell any meals on board. They just served passengers who had pre-booked their meals. When I asked for the chicken sandwich the flight attendant stared at me like I'd asked her to bring me an elephant from the zoo.

The crews are friendly the airplanes clean they still run a largely on-time operation and prices remain very affordable. The bad news is the pains associated with flying ""ultra low cost carriers"" are now beginning to inflict the airline. Seat selection was free the last time I flew them a couple of years ago but now they charge Rs. 100 per passenger. They also charge Rs. 50 to get a copy of your e-ticket at the airport. Neither one of those really bother me though. What does bother me is the bogus Rs. 200 ""convenience fee"" that you now have to pay to book online a fee that isn't disclosed until you get to the very last screen before payment. Even worse if you have to make a change to your reservation the ""convenience fee"" is charged every time you make a change.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,D Lancaster,United Kingdom,2015-05-31,This is without doubt the worst airline I have flown with. I did arrive safely at my destination which is the important thing but the 8 hour flight from Heathrow to New Delhi was completely lacking in anything describable as customer service. Jet Airways is let down appallingly by its surly unhelpful and in some cases unpleasant staff. They seem unable to smile bark orders out (and I'm referring to tray collection and window blinds here!) and excel at providing bad service. Everything and every passenger seems to be a chore to them. The airline's ground staff (Jet Airways desk at Mumbai airport) are equally rude and unhelpful. My advice - avoid travelling with this airline at all costs! There's plenty of others to choose from who excel at providing great customer service so choose one of those instead.,,,Economy,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,0

Airline was good in notifying us of delay in departing well in advance (inbound aircraft was late). Full 737 with average flight attendants and in flight entertainment. No food is offered on this flight other than a small amount from a buy-on-board menu. No big deal if you know this in advance as I did. Have a wonderful Irish breakfast at the Dublin airport before leaving and you'll be fine as the flight to St. John's is only 4 hours and 20 minutes.

Eight business class seats that barely reclined no foot rest no in-seat entertainment system just one very small video screen on each side of the aisle that dropped down from the ceiling and showed one movie. Food OK service good and friendly. Would not recommend Jet Airways for this segment in business class for a 5 hour flight - no value for price. BOM to CDG was on a modern A330 with herringbone flat bed business class seats great 100 channel personal entertainment system with a very large video screen massage function in the seat very private configuration power and USB outlets nice duvet for sleeping food and service very good. However our flight was 2 1/2 hours late taking off due to air traffic congestion in Mumbai. Because of this we missed a connecting flight in Paris and had to stay overnight. It took the ground staff 2 hours to sort out our new flight the next morning iand arrange for our airport hotel in Paris (Sofitel - they paid) but we were not able to retrieve our luggage so no fresh cloths the next day. Our return flights had ticketing/computer problems which caused delays with our check-in and none of the special meals we ordered through their website were ever delivered for any of our flights.

Check-in at Winnipeg was smooth with the self-serve kiosks reasonable wait for security and boarding was smooth (priority boarding due to exit row seat worth the extra price) as were departure and arrival in Calgary. Waited more than the announced 20 minutes for baggage to arrive at transfer carousel but customs was smooth. Despite many young families security was reasonable. Had time to relax at pay-in lounge. Renovations at boarding gate but hold room added extra space. Boarding was efficient with many children on this flight departed and arrived on time in Palm Springs. Baggage was within 20 minutes. Check-in at Palm Springs was efficient and handled well. Rode the Disney Plane back to Winnipeg a nice touch with interior decor. Departure and arrival on time and worth the extra for direct flight. Customs in Winnipeg was smooth and wait for baggage was longer than announced 20 minutes. On all flights snack and drink were served with water runs IFE functional with a number of selections on each plane and the cabin crew were friendly polite and efficient.

The very first negative experience was at the check in counter WestJet people meet you at the front of the line and push you to use a machine (before entering the line) where you must do all the work instead of WestJet agents. We had to scan our passports check in print tags weigh baggage as well tag our own bags. After all that was completed we had to go in a long line up and wait for someone to check our boarding passes and baggage tags and do something in their computer. After all that they made us put our bags on the baggage belt send them away. Why such a high price if they are making passengers do all the work? Boarding experience was not much better it was so disorganized and long due to excessive amount of carry on bags. People were bringing on huge bags. Inflight crew were ok but they were annoyed with the whole situation with carry on baggage. Soon as everything was sorted out we left the gate and took off. Inflight service was unreal seats super tight no movies or TV and no food. I am not sure why people fly WestJet?,,,Economy,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,0

The flight attendants were rude and treated us without much respect. If you ask them a question or if you ask them for a service they give you a look as if they have been insulted. When paying for a drink the selection of liqueur is extremely poor. Their website is of substandard quality and lacks features of many other airline websites. For example when checking in online from the US it won't allow you to send your boarding pass to your mobile phone to check in with. It won't allow you to put your pass ID for TSA pre-check so you won't be able to use the TSA pre-check lanes at security check in. When asked them why they don't offer these features now standard on all other North American airlines the answer was a simple ""we just don't"". On the plane the seats are extremely old and worn out.

The seats were very comfortable and I slept well. I had a 6 hour wait at the Mumbai airport. I took my time to admire some of the art at the incredibly beautiful international terminal. The transfer from the international terminal to the domestic terminal was easier than in past years. I was disappointed t learn that Jet Airways does not have a business class lounge at the domestic airport so my wait was not as comfortable as I would have liked. The service on the Mumbai-Goa flight was simply superb! We were in the air for just over half an hour and were served a full breakfast.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,R S Bains,United Kingdom,2015-04-17,London-Amritsar (18 March) return flight Delhi-London (14 April). If you are worried that transfer time at Delhi Airport which is about two hours may not be sufficient to go through immigration collect your baggage and then catch the onward Amritsar flight don't. You only need to collect your baggage. You don't have to re-check in for Amritsar flight at Delhi. Your baggage is checked in for Amritsar at London airport and you are given the Amritsar as well as Delhi boarding passes. At Delhi airport you collect your baggage go through the Green channel and head for Domestic transfer which is barely five minutes walk. At the domestic transfer your passport and boarding pass are checked. On entering domestic transfer you place your baggage on the conveyor belt and head for domestic security. The entire process - immigration collecting your baggage and catching Amritsar flight - takes no more than forty to forty five minutes. Moreover Jet Airways ground staffs at the baggage collection belt are there to guide you to the domestic transfer. However I have two complaints against Jet Airways. The first is that their in-flight service is simply appalling. The in-flight crew do bare minimum. They simply disappear after serving the meal. If you need anything you will have to run after them. There is however a good variety on the meal but not on the drink menu. You are unlikely to get a service with a smile on the Jet Airways - its in-flight crew in my views are not properly trained. My second complaint is its bad time-keeping. My Delhi-London flight was 1 hour 30 minutes late not because of any technical reason but because Jet Airways could not leave without picking up passengers from its Kathmandu-Delhi flight. If you are thinking of booking London-Amritsar flight your best option in my views is still Air India not Jet Airways.,,,Economy,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,2.0,0

These routes use Westjet's newest version of the B737 yet they are the most uncomfortable seat that I have ever sat in. Absolutely bare minimum support ultra thin and have no built-in entertainment system. Obviously the need to cram that extra row of seats into the aircraft is more important than customer comfort. On our return from Kona to Vancouver the plane seemed to have a very quick turnaround and after only 90 minutes into the flight all 3 toilets became inoperable and were overflowing. It was obvious that no servicing had taken place following the flight out and a full flight was forced to endure a further 4 ½ hours without using the onboard facilities.

It is very low class in front of its partner Etihad. But the second time around I was very disappointed. We were travelling from Mumbai to Bangkok and the first thing that we noticed on the plane was that there was no entertainment system! I was shocked and the final blow came when my mother asked for a blanket which are usually placed on our seats in all international flights and do not have to be asked for the attendant said that they had run out of blankets.

No issues at all with the internal flight - left on time and excellent crew. International flight both outbound and inbound was well below what we have become used to with Jet. We were sat at the back in the 2 seat config this time giving me a little extra room to stretch out 1 leg where the 3rd seat would have been. Seat pretty comfy. Staff were very low quality! On way out as boarding was occurring an argument broke out between two passengers - 4 crew stood around like spare parts whilst the passengers argument got more and more heated. Rather than take control of the situation to ensure comfort of all passengers they just stood there looking very lost. Totally and utterly useless! Service through the outbound flight was perfunctory at best and you got the impression any passenger awake they viewed as an inconvenience rather than someone contributing to their wages. The look I had when asking for a coffee mid flight said it all. Food was pretty good on outbound and return flight. On the return flight the staff were marginally better but not a lot. Again you got the impression we were an inconvenience simply being on the flight! Requests for more coffee or snacks was met with the look of ""oh if you must!"" They need to allow the volume to go higher to block out ambient background cabin noise! I wasn't using their own headsets having learnt before they are tinny ultra quiet and liable to fall apart but my own set and even with the volume on mine set to high with volume on entertainment unit set to high you could still hear much of the noise on the aircraft well other than the PA announcements which came through at a deafening level! In total contrast the staff on the internal flight were the polar opposite friendly welcoming humorous and did their level best to ensure a great flight and for them nothing was too much trouble. This is how Jet was on all their flights previously and this was quality of service combined with stunning value. The value Jet offers is very good on ticketing prices the inflight entertainment is pretty good and the food better than some - but their staff are really becoming budget Ryanair type staff.

The legroom was great due to WestJet putting in new slim seats but these were a bit hard and uncomfortable on your posterior. The other negative aspect was the complete lack of in-flight entertainment system! The reason given was that WestJet is rolling-out a new entertainment system where you can use your smartphones/tablets but this wasn't ready yet. They did however rent tablets with pre-loaded movies which seemed were quickly snapped up and looks like an extra way for them to make cash. It was frustrating that there wasn't even the moving map being displayed on flip-down screens (which didn't appear to be installed on that plane).

Bangkok-Mumbai sector seems to be where they send their old planes with seats falling to bits. They often feel overcrowded due to Indian passengers bringing on those huge striped bags bulging with stuff which are about 4 times the 'carry-on' size and don't fit anywhere..but fortunately this is only a short flight. From Mumbai or Delhi to London the planes are always new and pretty well served by the crews. I've had exceptionally good service and pretty poor service on Jet. But the ticket prices are always very good value so I keep coming back. I find the food is generally OK identifiable and edible. And that's about all. The crew don't mind getting extra food and drinks in my experience. Seats are small cramped and uncomfortable for anything over 5 hours. I often wander to the back door area to get the blood in my legs running again and I have found the crew - with the exception of a few rude guys - understanding and obliging.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Abraham Paul,India,2015-03-09,My Jet Airways 9W11 flight from Singapore to Mumbai on 1 Mar 2015 was a regrettable experience. It appeared that they used an aircraft traditionally used on shorter domestic routes on this sector. So leg space (space between rows) on the 5 hour flight was extremely cramped. What really made the flight unacceptable was that they turned off the aircon midway during the flight. It was only after the cabin became unbearable warm passengers were roused from their sleep and a passenger complained the aircon was switched on back - but barely so. The cabin remained uncomfortable. As others note cabin crew were curt - bordering on rude. Jet is now my least preferred airline.,,,Economy,,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,,2.0,0

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,C Martinez,United Kingdom,2015-02-24,I have never met a group of cabin crew so unwilling to help passengers. I though I was unlucky on my flight from London to Mumbai but the crew on the return trip were possibly worse. Clearly passengers are an inconvenience that should just go to sleep and not bother the crew. I was refused a coffee as we were an hour from landing (even though they still hadn't finished clearing from breakfast so it should have been a simple ask). Another major annoyance were the tannoy announcements all through the night telling us we were entering turbulence so should fasten our seatbelts. Most humane airlines mention at the start of a night flight that passengers should keep their belt visible so that they don't have to wake us. There were only 15 movies on offer of which only 2 or 3 are new releases. I won't go into details on the food I handed it back and got extra bread instead (though the guy was reluctant to even provide this). Hopefully never again.,,,Business Class,,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,0.0,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,H Bath,United Kingdom,2015-02-24,Unfortunately Jet Airways appears to have caught the Air India disease and is now offering quite a 'below par' service. The cabin crew are not attentive and a smile is seen as a bonus the whole thing seems to be a cattle truck these days. Our flight was delayed (these things happen) but there is little in the way of welcome when boarding and the crew clearly don't want to be there just simply going their motions. The headphones were broken both outbound and inbound tea and coffee unavailable inbound soft drinks well what can I say self service with a disinterested crew. Inflight was very disappointing to say the least some of the lowest quality I have come across in my travels. Drinks were simply rushed through and on 2 occasions had the cup and/or tray taken from my wife even though she was still eating! Not once but 2 times the reason was simple they wanted to rush through and get the job done for their benefit and not the customer. Overall the crew were unprofessional and left numerous blinds down during landing and were even walking around the cabin with the seat belt signs on! I doubt that conforms with their operations practices. This was a good airline but now seems to behave as if they're doing the customer a big favour.,,,Economy,,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,2.0,0

The worst flight experience we have had in many years and I was literally speechless. My wife and I was traveling with our 6 month old baby and upon boarding the aircraft in DEL we were miserably greeted by the not so interested jet airways air stewards and were not even looked at when trying to settle into our seats. There was no space in the overheads and the crew could see we were struggling but none of them lent a helping hand - totally unacceptable in any class of travel. The seats in business class are awful and something from 20 years ago with virtually zero recline. Food was served in large portions and was just ok. The aircraft is small (737) and there are only 12 business class seats in the formation of 2-2. Just a very awful experience all the way through and we tried to call to get a refund for out return but this was not possible.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Frederick Beaulieu,Canada,2015-02-18,Westjet was a very pleasant experience until very recently. The airline started charging for carry-on bags which ultimately has everyone scrambling to find available overhead bin space to stuff their luggage. Longest and most painful boarding I've ever seen - leading to most flights being delayed (delayed over 30+ minutes every time I fly with them). I can't blame this on the crew which keeps a smile on even though they are clearly annoyed with becoming baggage handlers instead of actually providing customer service and focusing on safety. I have no problem with Westjet offering a fee-for-service low-cost model however the prices should be reflective of that. Currently they are literally on par with Porter/Air Canada but with awful in-flight personal entertainment system and an ageing fleet. I would recommend flying Westjet only if it is significantly the cheapest option that you have.,,,Economy,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,3.0,0

I have flown WestJet regularly and can honestly report that I have never had anything but positive experiences. I normally fly the 'plus' class so the extra space and f&b service is always welcome and commonly I have a free row or at the very least an empty middle seat. Flight crew always warm and friendly. On this particular flight the Captain made a pre-departure announcement at the front of the cabin a nice touch. No satellite TV while in the continental US but the free feature films are more than adequate. With the poor experience many are having with Air Canada and in particular Rouge WestJet is well positioned to be the default go to Canadian product although admittedly I will often use US airlines based out of Buffalo for logistics and pricing advantages.,,,Economy,,9.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4.0,1

We flew back on January 9 2015 the same route. Flying 15.5 hours from Toronto to Delhi and back was a torture primarily due to: 1) Worn out seats with hardly any cushion 2) no hot water in toilets 3) filthy floor in toilets 4) toilet tissue running out on two flights with no one paying attention 5) poor quality of food and worst of all 6) waiting nearly two hours in Toronto upon our return for the luggage to arrive. More than half of the flight staff was courteous. We took altogether 8 flights with Jet Airways internationally and within India and none departed on time. At least on two International flights the seats were so stuck trying to get them to recline was a challenge. Although the entertainment selection was pretty good the headphones given out had gone through hardly any quality control; one of them was dead and another with its cable coming off. During the stop over in Brussels both time the passengers got out stood in long queue simply to go through a security check by extremely rude airport staff with no time to freshen up read: washing our face with warm water! It seemed no one controlled the temperature in the planes during flight at times it got too cold and then too warm.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,R Sawyer,Canada,2015-01-28,Flew Westjet a couple of times last year: YYZ-YEG and YYZ-YVR (return flights). I selected the Plus section over the regular economy and the modest extra cost was worth it for the additional value. The seat pitch is better than the back of the plane and all the usual nickel and dime extras are free (checked bags seat selection food). By the time you add up all the extras you would be hit with you can actually come out ahead. Throw in priority boarding and you get a much better experience than regular economy. I had occasion to compare this service with AC Rouge Premium YYZ-MCO and I have to say that Rouge was far better in terms of meals and to some extent service. The cost premium for Rouge however was far higher than the Westjet Plus so I guess you get what you pay for. For longer flights within Canada Westjet Plus will be my preferred option especially when compared to AC's J class which is prohibitively expensive.,,,Economy,,7.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,4.0,1

For an airline that promotes itself as the cheap and cheerful alternative to Air Canada it's no longer much of either anymore. Morning flights usually managed to arrive on time but afternoon flights were uniformly late. Cabin and ground service varied from enthusiastic to completely disinterested and disengaged. In-flight entertainment ranged from non-existent to broken. Fares were comparable to AC and the only reason I chose Westjet was because their flight times suited my particular schedules. It seems Westjet is trading on the good will it engendered in their early years. They seem to have run out of steam and are now content to wallow in mediocrity. Better fares and better service used to be their hallmark but there are no longer any reasons to choose them over Air Canada.,,,Economy,,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,2.0,0

As a larger person I found leg room shoulder room and personal space sufficient even with the seat in front of me reclined.

As a side note I was told this about the new fleet when I flew in March but I understand these things take time to be implemented properly. I flew WestJet over the past two years over the competition and make it a point to book with them and participate in their rewards program as I feel WestJet provides a better experience overall.

There was no Jet airways representative at the airport to resolve our travel problems. The travel desk required Jet airways to authorize the rebooking since they caused the delay.

The arrangements were so poor at Abu Dhabi airport that there were hundreds of passengers who had missed the flight due to Jet airways from various destinations were left without any help for many hours. I managed to get my tickets sorted after being in a queue for 8 hours. I have never had such a bad experience in 15 years of flying.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,R Lowry,Canada,2015-01-14,YYZ-GCM-YYZ Dec 21-Jan 4. Premium Economy. Westjet's flight to GCM is an easy way to get from Toronto to a beautiful Caribbean destination in not much more time than it takes to fly to Florida. GCM airport is bursting at the seams this time of year Westjet's flight arrives just after several U.S. arrivals so you are at the end of the customs line going in and it leaves just after these flights have reloaded so the departure lounge is full when you go back through security. But getting to the airport early to check in 2 hours before flight time and then taking lots of time at the open air restaurant on the second floor before hitting the now shorter security line after the U.S. bound pax have moved through works OK. I was originally sceptical about Westjet's premium economy service but now use it frequently on longer flights. Basically you pay what you would have paid for the type of service we used to get back when there was still some pleasure to be had inflight. The average passenger now gets a choice between the fully cost driven back of the plane service or something more comfortable at a price level many vacation passengers can reasonably afford something not possible if it is only Business or Economy with nothing in between. One final comment is necessary about travel to holiday destinations at peak times of the year. I like an aisle seat my wife likes a window seat nobody likes the middle. So I book D she books F and we take a chance on who will be in E as someone will certainly be on a busy flight. Usually not a problem but who should race into the plane just as the door was shutting but the dreaded 30 something male holiday oaf who spends his last day on the island or the mountain or wherever following his extreme sport passion getting to airport just in time to catch the flight but not in time to have a shower change his shirt or give himself a wash. We got him along with his desire to tell us about his great day.

Both flights were very comfortable and the flight crew were friendly and efficient. The Captain was able to get airborne in St. John's in very strong winds with minimal turbulence. Our problem occurred in Toronto with the transfer of our luggage to the connecting flight to Tampa. The conveyer system that brings the luggage to the transfer site was broken and all the connecting luggage had to be moved manually. There was a long wait due to the fact that only two porters had been assigned to this task. They were diligent but obviously stressed by the demands. We were able to catch our flight (it was delayed by WestJet) and much thanks to the lady working in the luggage transfer area who did quite the job of multi-tasking. I acknowledge this is not a direct WestJet problem but a problem for Pearson International. It does not help that we were told this problem has existed for weeks.

Though it was announced that boarding would be sequential this was completely ignored. There were multiple queues converging into one and the ground staff had to literally plead to people to form a single queue. The greeting by the crew was pleasant and it was not long before all were seated and the plane started taxiing. 20 minutes into the journey and the cabin crew wheeled in the food trolleys. Being a late noon flight we were served a warm roll (choice of paneer or chicken) a chocolate a tamarind sweet and a small bottle of water. I opted for the chicken roll which was tasty but quite dry. The service was very irregular and uneven. My aisle co-passenger received his food tray 5 minutes before mine. Within 10 minutes the crew returned to collect the trays. I was still eating my chicken roll and so the cabin crew member asked me to keep the chocolate and water and return the tray to him. Talk about a mad rush! Then they started serving tea and coffee again very randomly. My row was conveniently missed out. When I later asked for tea they politely refused saying that it was time for landing.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Margaret Lynne Beard,Canada,2014-12-22,We travel WestJet often from Vancouver to Toronto and then Barbados. Lately we have a major complaint with booking our flights. There is no indication whether the flight is direct or has stops. If the price is reduced because there is a stopover fine but let us know. It will then be our choice to decide if the reduced price is more important than our time. An extra hour added to an already long trip may not seem like much but to very tired customers who were not informed before booking the tickets it is very annoying. We like WestJet and it is convenient in Terminal 3 in Toronto for the overnight stop at the hotel but we seriously looking at the competition for our next trip.

Did not pre- book exit row but was able to reserve by checking in right at +24 hours for both flights. First time on WestJet and service was very much a la Southwest Airlines - friendly FAs although limited announcements from the flight deck. Will definitely consider in future as an alternative airline to Air Canada for short-haul domestic/US flights. IFE was okay with live TV available but the setup is now definitely dated with small screens and old armchair controls. If booking Emerg. Exit row 10 on the 737-600 do try to get the ABC side of the aircraft as the DEF side has no overhead bin space available due to emergency equipment.,,,Economy,,7.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,5.0,1

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Chris Vermeel,Canada,2014-12-18,Flew from YVR to Maui. I've always made the choice to travel with Westjet when fares have been comparable with AC. In this case it was the wrong choice. The inflight entertainment for a 6 hour flight was a limited selection of movies on a tablet you need to pay extra for. For kids there was really only one film they would be interested in and even that my kids got bored of. I'm sure there are executives at Westjet patting themselves on the back for the resounding success of the tablet service but really it's just a sign of desperation from their once loyal customers to find anything to do on a 6 hour flight. The other option they give you is a seat back pocket filled with rag magazines. We also made the effort to take 2 checked bags for a family of 4 but now with their check bag fee they're incentivizing us to each carry as much as we can a carry on. The only positive part of our flight was that they were on time both ways. With the line of service between AC and WJ being more blurred the folks running WJ are sadly sending their customers to seek other travel alternatives.,,,Economy,,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,2.0,0

I travelled with them last year for my vacation to and from Tampa Florida. I chose them again this year from Ottawa to Fort Lauderdale direct/non stop. The convenience of clearing US customs in Ottawa is worth it's weight in cash. I refuse to anymore to stress myself out by doing the hysterical rush through Toronto or Montreal to pick up baggage clear US customs and redeposit baggage and then get to connecting gate. The airlines never give you enough time to do that kind of aerobics. I did that last year for the last time. I was so happy this year to find a direct to Fort Lauderdale the day before my cruise and I booked a Plus seat for barely 100.00 more than the flex fare. That was also worth it for me.

The SIN-BOM sector used to be operated by the airbus A330 which was good since it was value for money and it was a bigger and more comfortable plane. Adding to a reason why you would chose jet over sq. (mainly for the money). But now they use the Boeing 737 which is a relatively small aircraft and very cramped. It was very uncomfortable. The food was ok although unnecessarily flavorfull. The TV had a good selection of movies however extremely inconvenient as the touch screen was very slow and required lots of pressure to select a movie. Overall it was a average flight. However I was very disappointed as I paid for a business class ticket for all my flights (all the way to London and back) but it was oversold so I was put in Economy. With no refunds but oh well its only a 5 hour flight. Luckily my flight from Mumbai to London was still business class. In fact they upgraded me to First class for compensation. But I did want to review the 737 business class product. Jet really needs to make their seats in the 737 more comfortable.,,,Economy,,6.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,,2.0,0

Flight crew on that flight were unfriendly and seemed annoyed when asked questions. We had originally booked and paid more to connect in Vancouver to Flight WS3293 with a 1h 20 min connection so naturally we felt a little rushed but felt this was ample time to connect flights. Upon arriving at the gate it took forever to get all the passengers off. We had asked for a cart to speed things up from the plane but were denied and told to speak with the Westjet desk outside of Customs. We rushed to Customs and were put through very quickly by CBSA. Because of the Customs rules we had to wait for our luggage which took well over 25 minutes to collect. We went to the Westjet connection desk we were told we had been re-booked for a later flight at 2130hrs. When we spoke with a Westjet attendant she couldn't figure out why we were re-booked in the first place without our knowledge as everything landed on time.

I did that oer a week and a half ago and no one replied. I usually fly Air Canada but Westjet advertised a better flight time.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Ankit Mishra,Australia,2014-10-28,Singapore-Delhi 9W017. Not sure where to start our most horrible experience up in the air. This wasn't due to any one-off disappointing event that biased the review but an overall awful treatment one is subjected to once they are locked in the cage for 6 hours. Seats: I am not sure if this airline is even complying with the DGCA regulations for how much space needs to be provided to the passengers. Almost everywhere you could hear passengers complaining of congestion. On top of that seats aren't comfortable. Our international flight was followed by a domestic one (on a different airline) which had much more room than an international flight by Jet airways. Food and Beverages: Food was tasteless. Indian food served on my previous leg (with Qantas) was far better than an Indian airlines serving the same cuisine. My wife didn't even eat it. As for the wine only suggestion I have for you is not to order it. The staff do not understand wines much but that can be overlooked given this was least of a concern on that flight. Ambience: Temperature setting did add to the discomfort it was too warm for me to feel comfortable in the pigeon-hole. This wasn't a 1 hr. short hop flight but a long 6 hr. which can even be hard to bear for a whiskey drunk passenger (pun intended). Advice to Qantas would be to reconsider their code share partnership as one doesn't pay a premium (to Qantas) to fly this bird cage. Connection to India will be a tough call given Air India isn't great either but at least they have new planes.,,,Economy,,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,2.0,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,S Talbot,United Kingdom,2014-10-28,Booked flights to Kathmandu via Delhi as did my niece - the outbound journey was a nightmare. We are both registered disabled with mobility problems - at Heathrow check-in we were promised 3 seats in order for us to stretch our legs. On both flights we were given 1 seat each rows apart with hardly any leg room. The seatbelt light was kept on most of the 1st long-haul flight so we weren't able to stand or use the toilet for hours at a time. The trip back was a dream the cabin crews were so attentive and on the Delhi to London leg we were both given 4 seats at the back so we could lie down. My advice to anyone with a disability would be to email customer services prior to booking detailing your needs. To anyone else I'd say Jet Airways isn't too bad considering the reasonable price of flights if you're a fussy eater and don't like spicy food take a packed lunch and take a cushion as the seats aren't very comfy.,,,Economy,,5.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,3.0,1

Usual ice cream before arrival in BOM always comes as a welcome surprise but despite the 9-hour flight being only half-full cabin crew failed to bring round any drinks apart from the main drink/meal-service passengers were expected to go and fetch their own from the galley. Is Jet now a self-service airline ? Perhaps the cabin-crew might tell us they won't be serving any extra drinks and to come and get our own in future? Gate-allocation for BOM-BKK was changed at least twice from 85A (written on boarding-pass) to 85C (on flight-departure screens) to 85B (eventually found after sitting waiting at the wrong gate for 30 mins) it was a shambles which can only cause passengers worry or even cause them to miss boarding.

The flight from Halifax to St.John's was not bad but was very basic with hard seats and no legroom. We thought that we would certainly upgrade to a larger plane for the cross Atlantic flight but we shocked when we got back on to the same plane. The fact that we had to re-book our seats for the second leg of the flight certainly led to the impression that we would not be getting back into the dinky seats that we had just left. It was the most miserable overseas flight I have ever had and there was no way either of us could get comfortable. Our video screens did not work and the staff only shrugged. On the return flight we upgraded to the Plus seats at a cost of 65 Euros each ticket. More legroom softer (but still narrow) seats and free but dry sandwiches. Free drinks not worth it since all we wanted was tea and juice. The video screens worked but I had purchased my own earbuds earlier in order to avoid the overpriced ones offered on the plane. A slight improvement but not what you would want in an overseas flight. At least we weren't in pain when we landed unlike the outbound journey. This was our first venture with WestJet. If I have anything to do with it it will be our last. I shall gladly pay a higher price for more comfortable flight.

I was expecting a standard international type flight and was astounded to find that in seat entertainment had to be paid for and that we were given a teensy packet of sesame sticks and drink only. Considering the high cost of the flights something more should have been standard.

We came from Dubai and had to take the 11.35 flight from Mumbai to Kozhikode on 8 April 2014. The function was at 18:30 the same evening. We approached the check-in counter well in advance at 9:45 and made to wait for about 20 minutes without being told why. We're then told the flight is overbooked and were asked to wait until 11:00. At 11:00 told that we cannot board the flight because it is overbooked. Overbooking flights is understandable. Most airlines do it. However with Jet Airways we were given a bad alternative considering our situation ""compensation"" of INR 3000 and told to take the 13:25 flight to Kochi and a 5 hour drive to Kozhikode from there. Not the best option for 2 girls who aren't familiar with the city. And guess what we face the inconvenience and we pay and arrange for all this. We were told that they would approach passengers to find out if anyone is willing to give up their seats. As it turns out this was not true because we had another friend on the same flight who mentioned this situation to passengers who were indeed willing to give up their seats. We were told that we would be assisted by Jet Airways staff at the Kochi airport with the taxi bookings. Didn't happen. While overbooking flights is normal the way Jet Airways handled this situation is unacceptable. At the end of it we had the impression that they did not take us seriously at the Mumbai airport.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,P Duende,Canada,2014-09-28,We went on a one-week vacation to beautiful Samana. Upon arrival to the Ottawa Airport we couldn't check in using my husbands passport due to WestJet making a mistake on his name. A very nice representative helped us at Ottawa airport to check in using my passport. On the flight from Toronto to Samana I ended up in the middle seat besides a drunken passenger who just shut the window blind down and spent the entire trip sleeping and invading my personal space. Those planes are small so having to fight off your little space with another passenger is draining. My husband sitting on the alley chair had half his elbow bumped several times by one of the flight attendants. The plane was smelly but at least it wasn't visibly dirty this time. In-flight food: Their free offerings were the poorest I've had the displeasure of experiencing: tiny glasses of water/soft drink/coffee and just two 14 grams bags of cookies or sesame sticks for a 4 hours flight. I understand this was supposed to be a value flight but it wasn't the least expensive in the bunch when compared with Air Canada offerings. All the above mentioned would have been forgiven and forgotten had it not been for the nightmarish experience we had on our flight back. As stated we were among the first to arrive at Samana airport once there we were given two seats together (window and middle): all nice until we got on the flight. The seats were not reclining and we had not been informed. Once the people in front of us reclined we realized that it was impossible for us to do the same. My husband called the flight attendant thinking there was a way of reclining but she just said it was not possible in a rushed manner as if we were a nuisance. For four hours we had to sit uncomfortably with our knees being constantly banged by the hyper kids sitting in front of us and without any possibility of rest. I do believe that if the airline is going to take away a passengers right to a reclining chair/cabin space they should at least offer some kind of compensation be it in the way of a pillow for their sore-necks or a food voucher. To make things worse the cabin on the flight back to Toronto was extremely dirty. The smell could be catalogued more as a stench.

First sector was on a new Boeing 737-800 from Toronto to Cayo Coco in Cuba. There was ample room for the shortish flight service was good and crew were good humoured. Bought wine on board and not over priced for airline. Flight left and landed on time. One week later made return flight this time on Boeing 737 - 700 which was obviously an older plane judging by interior. Again no problem good crew and flight to |Toronto was punctual.

I have found the customer service WestJet had in the beginning is not there anymore. I usually take the 10am morning flight out of Vancouver and have had no issues in the past. My last flight with them was on September 3rd to the 5th and I was very disappointed. The flight was delayed for more then 2 hours (it happens when you fly a lot no big deal) but my problem was that they didn't keep anyone notified on the status of the flight. On the way back it was even worse. My flight back to Vancouver was supposed to depart around 7:50 but we got delayed for a half hour which turned into 3 hours because of ""mechanical"" issues. Once again no WestJet staff were there to answer any questions or give us any info on the flights status. We didn't end up departing until ten to midnight. Too many times this has happened the last few months. I can't believe I'm saying this but I think I am going to start using Air Canada and fly on the less cramped Embraer 175.",,,Economy,,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,3.0,0

Part of the delay on Aug 31 was that someone was sitting in our seats - same seat# on Boarding Pass - turns out they had been on the previous flight and no-one bothered to check that they had the next (5pm) connecting flight to YVR and should have got off the plane!

I didn't think there was any chance of picking up more passenger planning to sit in these seats unless they were waiting for us on a cloud somewhere. The Flight Attendant told me that although the row was completely empty I couldn't sit there and needed to find a vacant row at the rear of the plane.

Fed up seeing the long faces of the staff with the occasional false smile not all their fault because the company is always trying to squeeze every cent of profit.

After waiting for almost 45 minutes we saw that the message displayed last bag. There were many people still waiting but none of our baggage came.

Entertainment selection was very poor but that didn't concern me much. Seats were okay. Toilets were not as clean and not at all fresh from the very beginning of the flight. Attitude of the crew were as if they wished they didn't have to serve the passengers. Not even once any of them said ""welcome"" or smiled to my ""thank you"" which I said out of habit every time any of them served me. Food was tasteless. Coffee was served cold both times. Trays was cleared much later after passengers were done eating. Some had to get out of their seat to go to the washroom and had to go through some ""acrobatic"" moves to get out of the seat holding up their food tray. Some already fall a sleep before the crew cleared the trays. At breakfast we were served only with a piece of cake and a small serving of fruits and cold coffee. It looked to me there was an empty space on the tray to serve breakfast item but nothing came. I strongly suspect that either they ""forgot"" to serve it or they were too late to serve the entree so skipped it all together. The time between dinner and breakfast was long on a 8 hours 30 minutes flight. No other snacks / drinks were offered in between.

Passengers weren't informed of this condition until 10 minutes prior to boarding! At the very least Westjet should have posted notice of this ""discount service"" flight online prior to our booking and reduced the price accordingly.

I further write this as one who travels frequently for both work and personal on this occasion with my husband and 2 children. We arrived at the cut off time for a 5.50 am flight. We were channelled into a line up for manual check-in. Note: for some reason I didn't receive the usual check-in notice 24 hours in advance to do online. I tried to do so but it wasn't allowing. We wait in line for manual check-in with one attendant. She continued to help one family for 20 mins (from the time we arrived). They appeared to be moving their lives from A to B. If we were earlier given the circumstance we still would have been notably late for check-in. No other attendant came over to help check people in. Meanwhile several people missed their flight to Calgary. Remember this is Regina SK. Finally our turn I learn that between 11-13 people per flight are randomly selected for manual check in and unable to do e-check-in. Odds are that 1 in our family of 4 was randomly selected which resulted in our inability to e-check-in. OK we accept missing the flight with the script from the attendant ""there is nothing we can do."" We later find out that a person who was quite far behind us was accommodated and put on the flight. We had breakfast with the family as we wait 4 hours in Regina to catch a different flight. Long story short: rude service upon initial arrival at airport short staffed at manual check-in no responsiveness from walker by attendants to help our family shuffle along while others appeared to be moved along others behind us accommodated.

Later in the afternoon they told us that the flight was delayed further to 20.10. 3 flights worth of passengers were held in the waiting area and no one was offered water or a food voucher.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,D Cronin,United Kingdom,2014-07-17,I would first mention that I have been a fairly frequent customer of Jet Airways over the last 7 years and generally find the company to be welcoming and efficient. This morning I flew JetKonnect 9W 2348 from LEH to Delhi. JetKonnect appears to be a low-cost arm of Jet Airways though in my opinion it does not seem to be very clearly differentiated from the main company in its marketing. I paid a very high fare for a one-hour flight sector in India. Despite having checked-in on-line the previous day and arriving at the airport 2 hours before the scheduled departure time with a printed boarding pass I had to queue for more than 45 minutes in a poorly managed utterly chaotic check-in area. There was no separate bag drop for already checked-in passengers. On eventually reaching the check-in desk I was told that I was 7 kilos over the 15kg checked-baggage allowance and had to pay an additional INR2000 in excess baggage charges. However I was 1kg under the 7kg cabin baggage allowance. I was invited to transfer 1kg of items from my checked luggage to my cabin baggage in order to save myself 1kg (INR300) excess baggage charge! This was hardly appropriate in the hectic environment and it seemed a nonsense not to combine the checked-baggage and cabin-baggage weight allowance. After all what difference does it make whether the total baggage allowance is carried as cabin or hold baggage? Given the very high fare charged by JetKonnect the hold-baggage allowance of 15kg seemed unreasonably low compared to industry standard of 20kg or 23kg. I was transiting to an international flight on another airline at Delhi airport and my hold-baggage was under-allowance for that flight. In order to complete the excess baggage payment I had to negotiate my way back through the security check-point to the terminal entrance where the Jet Airways ticket desk was located and then repeat the lengthy entry security check to return to the check-in desk. After dropping my checked baggage I proceeded to a long queue at the boarding gate. On eventually reaching the boarding point I was told to go back to a hold-baggage sorting area to identify my bag before it was loaded onto the aircraft. This unusual procedure had not been advised by the check-in agent and I saw numerous other passengers being turned back like myself to complete this task which had not been explained to them. It was therefore no surprise that the departure of the flight was delayed because of hopelessly inefficient ground handling.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,L Shulman,Canada,2014-07-13,We flew WJ for the first time in May 2014. I had booked a round-trip between Montreal and Fort Lauderdale. Our Plus seats 2 E/F for the first leg and 3 A/B on the way back. On the way to FLL the entertainment system in our row did not work at all. We did not make an issue of this because neither one of us were going to use it. At 6’3 the seats offer enough room for me to not cramp up but a standard emergency exit offers more. There is no extra shoulder room in these seats. The attendants were and the food/drink was fine. The flight was uneventful. On the way back to Montreal our entertainment system did not initially work and I upset this time because I wanted to watch a movie. I was offered the option to move seats but the system came on and all was well after that. Everything else was the same as the other flight. Given the choice between economy on any or WJ plus I will take the plus for the $40 upcharge.,,,Economy,,8.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4.0,1

It was my first experience with the airline and was a little nervous as the reviews were not that great. But surprisingly my flights were almost on-time. The food was delicious and satisfying. Alcohol was available whenever needed (a big plus point). The seat was comfortable. The only negative throughout the itinerary was at London Heathrow where there was some chaos but that too was not the airline's fault at all. Things to improve can be probably: the staff could be a little more visible when needed and use of better headphones to go with the great entertainment system. I have traveled on the Mumbai-London route a lot and Jet Airways is definitely up there.,,,Economy,,9.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,1
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Daman Malone,Canada,2014-07-08,"My wife and I traveled from YYC to YYZ on a trip to house hunt and visit friends. First issue was the flight out we had a 20 minute delay due to issues with the plane of course I'm glad they noticed the fuel leak before taking off but at least they could have done something to keep the over heated boring wait a little more enjoyable like hand out free headsets. I'm sure the $1200 for the return flight should cover a $3 (Cost price) headset also on the first flight the TV was jacked and flickering so watching any channel was a waste of time. Flight was ""Sold out"" so I could not change seats. Second issue was on the return flight. Is it ok for a father to encourage their child to scream and shout? I along with everyone in the 6 row radius heard these screaming kids after explaining to the father I don't want to hear your stories I just want a quiet flight back to YYC. I spoke to the stewardess and she just laughed and explained that she couldn't do anything.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Michael Dielissen,Canada,2014-07-08,I flew YYZ-BRU-YYZ in May and this was my second trip on Jet Airways. I have flown to Europe on KLM BA and Air France so I am comparing my experience with these airlines rather than other Asia carriers. Price - The price to Brussels on Jet Airways was about 20% cheaper than the Business Class fares on the carriers mentioned above that would have met my itinerary requirements. I usually book 2-3 months in advance and keep an eye out for seat sales etc. Lounge - At Pearson Jet Airways is in Terminal 1 and shares the lounge with Air Canada. In Brussels they have their own lounge which caters more to the Indian taste. (Not that I mind I enjoyed chicken wasabi sandwiches). Priority Services - The priority boarding has improved since my last trip in November especially on the Brussels site. I had no trouble accessing the gate agent and boarding the plane. InFlight - The inflight service is very well done the meals tasty a good selection of entertainment and fully flat sears for sleeping with sheets and comforter. Comparison to other carriers - I would say that other than price each one of the other carriers I have flown are better in one respect but not the others. Jet Airways is number 2 in all the categories for me which makes it an all around good experience and is why as long as they are the same price or cheaper I will fly them over the other choices. (BA has the best seat but the worst food the worst airport to transit ok service - Air France has the best food but I don't like the seats KLM usually has the best service but the worst seats).,,,Business Class,,8.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,1

They did not have the VLML meal that I had pre-ordered and confirmed with them twice before the flight.

AV doesn't offer much but that doesn't matter because I always bring my own reading material. Didn't purchase on-board food items. (As most Canadians do for domestic flights I bought things from a sandwich counter near the departure gate just before boarding.)

The flight was over booked and late. Then finally we all boarded (there was no signage for where to board for the economy class passengers) amidst some confusion. The Captain then announced that there was a technical error and it would soon be fixed. This continued for over four hours until we were finally deplaned at 1 am. In this interim we were served dinner. The crew was not available or responding to any call bells for water etc. They just kept ignoring all passengers even the elderly and those with children. After we were deplaned the nightmare continued. It took two hours for the ground staff to arrange hotel accommodation and in the interim they refused to tell us which hotels etc. We were expected to empathise with them! Clearly they were unprepared and had not thought ahead to plan for such a situation. We lost a night and a full working day as well.

The delay stretched on and we sat on the tarmac until close to 2.45 with no further information. Some lucky passengers got drinks (many did not) and no food was served. Then we were informed that the technical glitch would take several hours and that we would be deplaned. It took another half hour to get us off the plane and then complete chaos reigned. There were no instructions on what to do next or where to go. There were 2-3 Jet ground staff members surrounded by knots of increasingly angry passengers demanding guidance. The Jet ground staff appeared totally clueless on how to handle the situation. One staff member said we would get new boarding passes (not clear where) while another said that the Delhi based folks should go home and come back at 11 for a 2.15 flight. There were many passengers who were from outside Delhi or who were tourists/visitors who had checked out of their hotels - they were told that hotels would be arranged. There was no protocol no clear communication - utter chaos. It went on this way all the way to the airport exit - when I left at 5PM there were still several passengers (including elderly folks) waiting for a coach to take them to a nearby hotel. I have noticed a sharp fall in the service quality at Jet - the staff used to be friendly and competent about 10 years ago but have become brusque dismissive and unpleasant besides increasingly incompetent in recent years.

However I phoned a phone number here in New Zealand and the consultant worked hard to come up with a suitable alternative for me which meant longer flights and less sleep but ensured that I got to where I needed to be and charged me no extra. I got the feeling that running on time was very important to the airline one leg was 10 minutes late and it was made clear to us that it was due to a late inbound aircraft due to congested air traffic (ie: not Jet Airways' fault). They hurried us through boarding so that time could be made up. Food and staff were fine check-in staff very helpful and friendly. Ironically at the slightest bump in the sky seat-belt sign was on and we were told to remain in our seats yet prior to take-off staff didn't come and check seat-belts and also a passenger two seats over from me was busy talking on her phone during take-off and staff didn't address this even though the safety briefing had been very clear.

Cabin crew member in charge made no effort to greet passengers upon entering interior of the plane clean but worn. Inseat screens with poor quality and cannot be switched off. Two rounds of drinks and food for purchase. Crew appearance lacks professionalism. No farewell as crew already stuck with their heads between the seat rows cleaning the seat pockets.

Although they were touted as being for low demand small market use you will get stuck on them on main routes. If you pay for a Plus fare you get ripped off as there are no plus fares seats on these planes. Everyone gets the same hard as rock tight and vibrating seats with lots of noise! And you get to enjoy all that discomfort for longer because they are slow! If it is winter the Plus fare gives you the extra joy of being the first people to board and then freeze your butt off because these planes board from the runway.

I was in Seat 2A and the edge of side of the seat was broken and patched with industrial tape! When the passenger pushed his seat to a recline position (and these are not flat beds) he knocked back my food tray and my video. It also made coming out of my seat to visit the toilet very tough.

The check in counter staff are also more than pleasant! The inflight entertainment is perfect as their are individual screens where there are about 5 different channels all showing different movies! This is brilliant as you can choose which movie you prefer and when its done you can just switch to another channel for another movie (my flight was about 5.5 hours!).

I can completely understand that poor weather conditions are not Westjet's fault. However during the same period of time 2 Air Canada flights successfully landed at YQB (one from YUL and another from YYZ) with yet another leaving YYZ for YQB at the time as our plane arrived back in Toronto. Instead of refuelling and heading back to YQB flight was cancelled and we were left to fly the following day delaying arrival by 14 hours for a 1 hour flight.

I had planned another flight from London to Stuttgart at 8.45am GMT (2 hours later) keeping in mind check out immigration and check in time. The flight from Mumbai took off 4 hours later at 5.40 in the morning. Now I have been on flights that have been delayed and it is no new experience for me. What was new for me though was the way in which the whole issue was dealt with. The first officer announced 10 minutes before scheduled departure that the flight was being delayed 15 minutes due to maintenance checks. Almost 30 minutes later the Captain came on and said that there were delays and due to a technical check we would be delayed by a further 30 minutes. Almost an hour later we were told that there are even further delays and through out the entire time span the passengers were left absolutely clueless. Never ever before have I been on a flight where the ETA on the flight information screen was only shared with passengers on the Inflight Entertainment 30 minutes before landing.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,C Johnson,Canada,2014-04-24,I just booked a trip from Winnipeg to Las Vegas. The departure and return times are ridiculous that is if you want a direct flight. The departure time is at 21.50 while the return time is at 00.30. Not wanting to return at that time I arranged to switch times and take a later flight in return only to discover that any later flights required a stop over which adds hours onto your travel time. Meanwhile there are more than one direct flight to other cities. Calgary springs to mind where there is one trip at 08.00 and the next around 10.00 or 11.00. A few years ago when I returned from Mexico again having to stop in Calgary many of our companions were immediately able to get on connecting flights while those going to Winnipeg had to wait until the next day which added to our costs. I am beginning to think WestJet has something against Winnipeg because after having to pay $266 for a return flight at a more reasonable time with now a stop in Calgary I am not liking WestJet so much.,,,Economy,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0

The 45 minute flight from Mumbai to Goa was fine too. With a soft drink and a snack meal served. Return flight were very good also and all were virtually on time within a few minutes Before landing the Stewardess came round the Cabin and thanked each passenger for travelling with Jet. A nice personal touch. Jet Staff had taken all the Business Class passengers hold baggage off the carousel and kindly put it into a roped off area in front of the baggage carousel.

Got the red carpet treatment off my incoming Jet domestic flight as I was met by Jet ground staff and ushered into my own car for the journey to the International terminal whilst the latter is a huge improvement on its predecessor the way transfers work between the two terminals remains a bit barmy borne out by the fact that my car took the public roads! The First Class lounge is pleasant enough but generally continues the Indian tradition of largely mediocre airport lounges. On board the ""hardware"" is pretty impressive - flat beds enclosed suites and the like although I didn't find the seat/bed as comfortable as I would have hoped given its generous proportions.

I have always been proud to fly this Calgary based Airline in Canada. I fly frequently 5-6 times a year and it was on a flight from Calgary-Toronto that I was bumped into Plus Seats which was great. However on my return flight from Ottawa a week later I was back in economy seating as I had purchased economy for both inbound and outbound but when I sat down I had to squeeze myself into the seat. This has never been a problem before and I was sitting at the bulkhead on the 737-6 so I requested to move from a flight attendant. I am 6'4"" so flights have always been a little tight but this was like nothing I have experienced. The flight attendant accommodated my request to the seats in front of the exit row that don't recline. Same problem when the person in front of me put their seat back. I again requested to move into and the only seats available were in the exit row mid-cabin which was empty but I was told I couldn't sit there as they were Plus Fare seats. I was shocked! I can't help being tall and had I known I would have purchased a plus fare in Ottawa. The flight attendant did not allow me to sit anywhere else and it was by far the worst flight I have been on. I contacted Westjet with my disappointment and received a standard auto-generated letter back. If you are over 6ft tall and/or have legs longer than 32inches BUY PLUS FARE.

My major complaint would be that all the cabin crew (bar one) disappeared once the meal had been served and did not appear again until the next meal. No one came around offering water and the toilets were not serviced. Despite all of this of the cheap budget airlines flying to Delhi (and return) they are not the worst.,,,Economy,,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,4.0,1

Overall good. Which amazed us as two years ago we flew London to Delhi and back and swore never to use Jet again as the flight home was the worst we've ever had anywhere in the world. This time the flight from London to Delhi was very good nice plane good crew average food. Internal flights were also good. The flight back - well it was an older plane a bit tatty inside the floors hadn't been cleaned properly between flights the food was terrible the seats sagged but it landed ahead of schedule and the cabin crew were great. So 4 flights out of 5 were very good and if they put on a new plane and better food on the last leg they'd have scored a very good overall.,,,Economy,,7.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,,,4.0,1

We are senior citizens and have lots of air travel experience but this one was the worst so far! There was no water in the toilets! The flight from HYD to AUH arrived and landed but it took more than an hour before we could get off the plane! Apparently Jet seems to have the least priority by air traffic control. Me and my wife had to sit near a stinking toilet for the 526 flight. They closed all toilets. Imagine having no access to toilets in mid air!

On the flight out they kept us on the runway from 11.30-2.30 while dealing with fuel line issue and during this time served us 2 very small cookies. They then flew us to Toronto to get to a plane that could fly farther and served en route only alcohol or water. The flight was full of starving kids who had been on the plane for 4 hours but we were told no food or other drink because flight to Toronto ""too short."" We were in seats in front of the exit row which did not recline and we were not warned about this. For the flight back we could not check-in online because they wanted to charge us extra for our seats on the way out even though our seat selection said zero dollars when we chose it. On the flight itself in-flight entertainment broken meals were cold sandwiches and by the third row they were out of all sandwiches except turkey. On arrival in Montreal there was no attendant to connect that plane to the gate so the pilot had to call for one. Ten minutes later we saw him scampering up the ladder to the gate. Then they let us off but no one had opened the door from the gate hallway to the airport so another 10 minutes there.

For the first few hours there were no communication and it became clear this airline has no contingency plan and should not be flying. As business class passengers we received no support and passengers were physically prevented from leaving the plane though we were about 25 metres away from an airbridge. Half the plane without connections were put on another plane to Singapore and we were kept detained on the plane for another few hours. Eventually a Customer Service Manager appeared.

For going took Jet Airways 9W 09 on the 737-800. Flight was for the same price as the one hour earlier 9W 11 on the A330 for the same SIN-BOM flight and yet the PTV was barely working. It kept on switching on and off. The passenger beside me could barely use hers with the very poor touch screen. Content was minimum and not what I expected from India's premium airline. Food was good but we weren't even served the usual tea/coffee. Seats were uncomfortable. Coming back flew the A330 On 9W 12 BOM-SIN. PTV was MUCH better this time round and seats were a much bigger improvement over the 738 flight but food wasn't as good. FA's were pleasant and helpful on both flights. While definitely India's best premium airline when compared to Air India it still doesn't live up to the much higher standards of Kingfisher Airlines when I flew it on the same sector few years ago which was on an A320 but the experience of KF was still definitely 5* and better. If SQ and 9W have the same pricing on the SIN-India routes would recommend no doubt SQ. If prices are very different for both with SQ being much (500SGD?) more expensive then Jet does still give a pleasant flight for the sector.

We all had to line up to get reassigned to other flights. They seemed completely bewildered and disorganized. There were 4 counters for check in. There was a gentleman who was asking people where they were going and several of us found ourselves in the wrong line. Check in was slow and tedious. Waited in line for over 1.5 hours to be asked to stand to the side. For some reason I was not already rebooked on another flight. The co-ordinator did give me food vouchers so added points for that.

Because of weather conditions the plane that was scheduled to go to Aruba to pick up and bring back the passengers from flight 2699 never arrived Tuesday Jan 7th 2014. After an entire day trying to call and get an answer from the airline finally with got to speak with somebody from Westjet who only said that there would not be a rescue flight later that week but passengers had to wait until Tuesday Jan 14th 2014 to get our fight back home but they were not responsible for any expenses until that day. In my case we had to take a flight Aruba-Curacao and Curacao-Trinidad and Trinidad-Toronto with all the expenses it caused in airplane tickets meals and hotel.

Due to the ice storm in Eastern Canada all flights were delayed not anyone's fault. Flights were pleasant and comfortable and staff eager to assist. Upon arrival in Saskatoon very delayed at 3am we discovered my partner's suitcase was broken when it came off the plane. Expecting a hassle we went to the Westjet baggage counter. The agent was superb offered a choice of a $75 voucher for future travel or a ""bag-swap"". In the short time from the airport to where we were staying there was an email apologizing for our inconvenience! Super service. Will recommend Westjet!",,,Economy,,10.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4.0,1
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Warren Moore,Canada,2014-01-08,When it comes to airlines ultimately whether they are any good or not really depends upon how they act when things go bad. In the past things have gone wrong with Air Canada and I've had to fight to get a hotel and a seat on an upcoming flight in reasonable time. My flight on 3rd January from Toronto to St. John's was cancelled because of a terrible snow storm in Newfoundland. Within 30 minutes I was in a hotel with meal vouchers. On the 4th the plane was cancelled again and the same thing happened no questions asked we were all shipped off again. On the 5th WestJet had put on 2 extra planes to deal with the backlog WS 4150 and WS 4175 leaving at 7am and 8am respectively. I was on the latter plane which was a little delayed because the attendants had just come off the inbound Halifax flight. Nonetheless it was all in good humour and no one had any cause for complaint. WestJet had gone beyond what anyone could ask for to get us all home. Air Canada flights were cancelled at the same time and some of those waiting to travel have been told they can't go until Wednesday. They may well argue it's not economically possible to put on an extra plane but if WestJet can do it the flag carrier can. I read a lot of reviews here about how a plane was a bit late the seats not that comfy and the food of a not great standard. All that actually occurred on my flight but these are small things in the main. An airline needs to be judged on looking after the best needs and Westjet delivered. Will use again and look forward to it!,,,Economy,,10.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,,,5.0,1
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Rajendrakumar C Patel,United Kingdom,2014-01-07,Passengers travelling business class are looking for four things in my opinion: First peace and quiet. Jet Airways flight 9W 0118 on 31 December 2013 from Mumbai to London had two kids in the section who did not have a seat of their own and shared seating with 4 adults spread through out the cabin during the entire duration of the flight. The kids screamed the place down and ran amok throughout the cabin. I could not sleep at all on a nearly 10 hour flight. Second. The lounge experience. Lousy is the best description I can come up with. Both outward flight from London and Return flight from Mumbai lounges were shared and were poor at best. Third entertainment. My seat 11A had a non functioning screen! It was locked in a position in which nothing could be viewed. The cabin crew apologised but obviously could do nothing about it. Meal choices. Very limited. And finally cabin comfort. The cabin is laid out in herring bone fashion the fold flat bed does not accommodate a 1.85 meter man. the décor is old fashioned in beige and brown. Shame on you Jet. Old planes indifferent service and clearly unaware that there is competition on this leg. You really do not expect me to be on board your aircraft again.,,,Business Class,,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,0

When I checked-in I was told my luggage had exceeded the limit of 15kg. While I understand that such limits are imposed on domestic flights but for someone who is on a long business trip in India who has been allowed up to 20kg or 30kg on international flights how do the authorities expect us to shed off excess weight when flying from one city to the next within India? I was asked to pay for the exceeded amount at a Jet Airways counter. When I went to the counter the service was extremely slow. The counter staff were more interested in attending to the sale of tickets. Onboard there is lack of discipline by staff. People were still talking on their phone after the announcement was made not to do so. This is the second time I have flown on Jet Airways. Their lack of interest in the well being of the passengers is worrying. I will never fly Jet Airways again if I can help it.,,,Economy,,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,3.0,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,L Douglas,United Kingdom,2013-12-25,Flew LHR-BOM-HKG in August and then returned on same route just before Christmas. LHR-BOM was less than 30% full resulting in a great quiet flight. Departed on time and arrived early. Bulkhead seat with lots of legroom friendly crew who even offered hot towels on departure to economy passengers because business class was so empty. In flight entertainment relatively extensive and food was okay - offered a curry meal plus a hot chicken wrap later on. Drinks were offered several times. Seat was comfortable and overall a great flight. BOM-HKG night flight was packed full. Had a seat near the back with pretty bad legroom. Served ice cream upon departure and breakfast (which was vile) before landing. Return flight a few months later to BOM was 100% full. Bulkhead seat again so leg room no problem. Entertainment and food were still pretty good and crew were as friendly as ever on Jet. The cabin was absolutely freezing though. Final flight BOM-LHR was pretty poor. Seats and entertainment still good crew still friendly. But absolutely no drinks or food offered for the first 8 hours! Breakfast eventually served but I passed having experienced the horrors of breakfast on Jet a couple of months ago. Biggest problem is Mumbai airport - the transfer process is confusing and unorganised and the airport itself is horrible. Not really Jet's fault though I guess.

Journey from Hyderabad - Delhi was fine without any issues. At Delhi airport we were informed that the 10.40 am flight would be delayed and would depart at 12.00 pm. At around 11.45 am the cancellation of the flight is announced apparently due to dense fog at Patna airport. At this point there was no Jet Konnect representative at the gate. We were directed to another gate where one representative was dealing with requests from passengers of two cancelled flights. From there we were taken to the baggage collection area and were asked if we would be interested in taking a refund or travel to Ranchi instead. We chose to travel to Ranchi. They took my boarding pass from Delhi - Patna and said that they would be giving me a Delhi - Ranchi pass. When my name was announced I see that I was handed my old Hyderabad - Delhi pass. On reaching Ranchi (4 hours after our scheduled arrival in Patna) we asked if we would get any monetary assistance for further travel to our original intended destination.

Return flight DEL-BRU the 1st December was completely the opposite though. Before takeoff menus were distributed and you had to give your choice. I hardly had the chance to look at the menu when the rude stewardess said I had to make my choice. Once my choice made she grabbed the menu out of my hands and took it back. Food was the most terrible I ever had on a flight. The refreshment was tiny and extremely spicy and was served as good as cold. Breakfast even was worse with a few slices of tasteless unripe fruit smashed on a plate followed by a cold omelette and 2 hard cold greasy discs that were expected to be hash brown potatoes! Just as with the refreshment served earlier presentation was inexistent and looked like everything was just smashed on the plate. I told the stewardess this was the worst meal I ever had on a plane.

We had a flight out of Delhi FLT # 9W7125 at 8.35. We received no phone call of our flight being canceled and arrived at the airport 2 hours before. Apparently they called some passengers but not all. We then heard it was canceled after we waited in line. The best they could do was put us on a 2.30 flight. The 2.30 flight came and went no flight took off. They could not tell us anything except that it was delayed 1 hour. Then it was delayed again nobody could tell us the truth. The truth being the city the flight was originating from was delayed due to weather and had not taken off yet. Why not just tell us that and try to book us on another flight. There was much chaos at the airport and the passengers were in an uproar. Nobody was giving them answers. Finally the plane arrived and we eventually took off at 6.30. This is 10hours after our original flight we arrived at our final destination at 2am! To top if off they actually wanted to charge us for meals on the plane after waiting that long.

Jet's boarding process is probably the most orderly and efficient I have experienced. If only other airlines supported their front-line staff so that they could make sure that the aircraft was filled from the rear and time was not wasted waiting behind someone in Row 10 who took his or her time settling in. The service was good and the food excellent particularly the vegetarian option. The seat could be more comfortable: has some efficiency expert removed inches of foam to make the aircraft lighter. This could be Jet's weakest link. The baggage was on the carousel as soon as I cleared immigration which is another pointer to Jet's attention to detail and understanding of process. My only problem was that some ""helpful"" handlers had removed bags from the carousel and stacked them in a line on the far side without letting people know. I wasted about 40 minutes until this a handler mentioned this stack. I recognise that the baggage from a large aeroplane like a 777 could clog a carousel but better clearer visual indicators should be considered when handlers have to clear a carousel.

No TV screen on the seat. If you want to watch anything you have to pay to obtain portable TV. For a 5.5 hour flight they only offered beverages twice with a tiny package of cookies or corn chips. Too much air conditioning but no blanket offered for night time flight. The most offensive service was the fact they put garbage magazines such as People or Star in the front pocket. I guess they assume all the passengers have very low IQ's to enjoy such a tasteless entertainment. This is actually 100 times worse than no entertainment.

It seemed only a few of the passengers were offered newspapers before take off - one needed to ask for this. Once in the air the IFE system seems remarkably limited but playback works well - though headgear needs to be updated. The food was tasty but lacking in quantity - though the appetizer was well- received. It was interesting that the male steward was much more warm and friendly than either of the female ones. Staff service was professional but one felt awkward expecting them to be more welcoming than they were - this could be easily remedied. Good choice of beverages on board.

Cabin-crew worked hard to serve drinks and a good meal hampered by the usual queue for the loos and passengers wandering up and down to visit friends. The B777-300ERs on longer flights into/from LHR were clean but the new 3-4-3 seating is much more cramped than 3-3-3 last year especially as I was given an exit-row seat (50C) on the return-flight this was so narrow (due to control-panel reducing space and hard-sides instead of armrests) that I had to literally wedge myself into it ! Luckily the cabin-crew helped me change seats when asked. Web check-in was not available for the return trip. Hopefully the new tie-up with Etihad may eventually lead to seat-selection becoming available when booking or pre-travel not just (if it works) with web check-in! No lounge-access offered for any of the 4 airports despite Silver ff-status but a welcome extra 10 kgs hold-allowance. Overall the trip was OK good value-for money DEL stopover was fine and BOM security/terminal remains its usual mess not the airline's fault. Roll-on the new terminal still under-construction !

Ground staff were terrible and were completely confused that we had 2 extra bags. We told them repeatedly to just tell us how much extra we needed to pay. The worst was coming back from Nepal. We were put in a holding area in New Delhi. The staff would shout ""You go sit for 30 minutes."" We were not told why. Finally told that Air France agent would be there in an hour to talk to us about the extra bags. He came after over an hour but didn't know what to do. After 2 hours we paid. I asked for a receipt and was told I could get one at the gate. I didn't try to get it as was afraid that it would cause another big wait. People were being sent back to the agent because he didn't put his name on the ticket or didn't circle the flight. I just wanted out of there. Then 2 of the bags were sent to Salt Lake City (We live in Nashville) with a different name. Thankfully the tags were right and we received them the next day!

Now they are back to the Boeing 777 with 3-3 configuration with cramped seats. Taking the night flight out of SIN after a long work day makes the whole journey painful.

This on top of the fact we were not only charged the extra baggage fee for second bag but an additional $50 for oversize. That being our bike bags which are streamlined sleek and weigh approximately 20 pounds each. Our flight last Tuesday morning from Vancouver was also delayed an hour and a half but at least they didn't charge the oversize fee in addition to the second bag fee. The reason for the delay here as explained by the very unsympathetic Westjet supervisor is they are re-fitting the aircraft.

Onboard televisions offered only about 4 channels (movies) - regular channels didn't work at all. When leaving the Dominican I specifically asked for a window seat on the left side of the aircraft so as to be able to see the Turks and Caicos islands. Got a wall seat (no window) on the right side of the plane! Tried to check in online the day before and the airport (POP - Puerto Plata) will not come up on the drop-down window so you cannot check in online. This resulted in waiting lines when bus loads of people all arrive at the same time and it clearly overwhelms the counter staff who don't know their left from their right.

Only after much insistence with the sour-faced check-in attendant and asking several times to speak with the check-in supervisor was at least an aisle seat made available to me. Then I was told that as my luggage was 23 kgs I would have to pay for excess. It seemed to me that this was punishment for my causing a fuss. Inflight it seems to me that Jet Airways once nice planes are tired cramped and in desperate need of a refurbishment. In-flight service the service was okay but not what it was once.

Westjet dares to give you the choice between a 100g snack pack or 2 miniature cookies (do not dare asking to have them both).

No one at the airport in Toronto could help me and one Westjet worker at the baggage area even told me I should have informed them that I had a tight connection and they would have sent them to Moncton (my final destination) with the next Westjet flight even though I was connecting with Air Canada. This was completely astonishing and untrue. When has it ever been ok for you to leave your bags and go on a flight with a different carrier and expect the other carrier to send your bags along. Anyway all Westjet reps I spoke with at Pearson told me to call the 1-800 number on the website which I did and I was told that 2 hours is not enough time for a connection with a domestic flight.

Every flight left on schedule and most of them landed ahead of scheduled time. This airline operates like clockwork. It is very reliable. Baggage handling has also been very reliable - even through Delhi because it is in the hands of the one airline and they apparently make sure bags are transferred when they should be.

I had some difficult passengers behind me and they dealt with them with as much patience as they could. I enjoyed the food and felt that they came round often enough to offer drinks.

There cost does not go up if we leave on the earlier flight. To make matters worse we were told that changing to the earlier flight would be free if our flight was showing as delayed. At the time it wasn't so he couldn't do anything. Even though we have a 4 month old baby that we now had to keep happy in the airport for 5 hours. To top it all off shortly following the earlier flights departure we learned that our flight would be delayed.

The Staff at the gate took care of everything courteously and professionally. I expected to have to go back to the front desk and go through security again but he took care of everything while I was able to watch Euro cup in the lounge!

On return flight we were warned to expect a long drawn out check-in and delays at passport control in Cochi. The only delay at check in was being given a complementary upgrade to business even though we had a non upgradable ticket. Passport security and visa checks were numerous but better than we had been told. Flight left early and the business cabin although small was better than expected for such a short haul flight.

I had very little time to connect in Chennai and was running from gate to gate with my luggage. I had to clear immigration security and guess what they use the same boarding gate and bus for 2 flights to Singapore and Colombo. This caused a lot of confusion even though I finally managed to get on the Boeing 737 to Singapore. Seats were quite narrow but legroom was plenty because I chose exit rows. I didn't care much about IFE. One FA told me they ran out of blankets and the other one promptly got it to me 5 minutes later. The meal was decent but the dessert was very nice. We arrived at an excellent time in Singapore (8am). Return flight was just the opposite. Inflight experience was excellent on Airbus 330 from Singapore to Bombay. Seats and legroom was excellent. They served decent meals and again the dessert was above average. Headphones were not working I asked for a replacement and they gave me a second one which was worse.

I had the misfortune of sitting directly behind a couple who's two babies screamed incessantly for the vast majority of the flight. The cabin crew showed about as much interest in shutting them up as the parents did. As a result a long flight made seemingly longer due to the constant racket and lack of sleep. I flew business on the way out and the attitude of the cabin crew was pretty lax. Once they'd handed the food out they were not to be seen again until breakfast was served. The return leg in which I flew economy wasn't much better in terms of the attitude of the cabin crew. The only way I've been able to guarantee a non-veg meal is to request it when booking-in online. All in all not too happy with them.,,,Economy,,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,3.0,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,J Athwal,United Kingdom,2012-05-03,I was a loyal business class passenger and recommended them to others. Sadly they have lost their charm of late after my experience having flown LHR-BOM and also LHR-HKG via BOM both journeys in Business class. Seats probably the best in the airline industry but very noticeably the food and beverages have deteriorated considerably. The main meal is limited in choice and presentation has faltered even drinks have been downgraded and the frequency of the offer has been drastically reduced. The transfer experience at Mumbai has to be the worst in the world and although not Jets fault reflects badly on them. An hour and 20 mins to security check between International flights is well beyond acceptable.,,,Business Class,,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,4.0,0

Westjet offers the only direct service (seasonal) between Vancouver and Palm Springs which is great; unfortunately some return fares are greater than a flight to the UK! Flights into LAX (a similar distance) are much less costly likely due to competition! Consequently we fly into LAX and pick up a rental car for a 2 hour drive to PS.

Those seats are not comfortable. The inflight entertainment system is ridiculous. The so called ''live TV'' when the crew makes an announcement doesn't even stop.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,P Tolnai,Canada,2012-02-15,I've flown Westjet numerous times in the past few months and despite loving their inflight service and the comfort of their seats I have to say it's time to upgrade or do away with inflight entertainment service. I have not been on a plane lately where a TV screen near me was malfunctioning. If the person in the middle seat touches the box with their foot you can see all three screens flicker. Perhaps they should get rid of in- seat entertainment entirely and replace it with wifi and maybe a return to meal service.

I have never transferred on a flight before so I followed the people leaving the plane. They all went downstairs to the luggage area. I knew I didn't need to get my luggage because they told me it would be put on my next plane for me. I stopped at the information desk and asked where I was suppose to go for my ticket. I was told to hurry up the stairs and go through security because I was going to miss my plane going to Grande Prairie. When I got through security I was told I had missed my plane and to go and see West Jet about getting on another. I was told it was my fault that I missed my plane and I was dawdling around. I told them exactly what happened and they said that was not so and I should have known not to come downstairs. I should have known to just get off the plane and get right on the other one. No one ever told me this nor did they ask me if I knew. I should have been let off the plane along with the people leaving for Toronto so I would have made my flight. I had to pay another $52.50 to get on the next plane. I am very disappointed in the way West Jet handled this and how they treated me. Never mind waiting another 9 hours in the airport to catch the next flight I should not have had to pay $52.50 for it.

Generous baggage allowance at that time 2 checked bags 50 lbs each per passenger no cost. Now only one bag for free but this is still better than many other airlines. Check-in at YVR was quick no big lineups and assistance by WestJet staff was available for people who hadn't printed their boarding passes ahead of time. We had ours already so were able to go straight to check-in. Boarding is unstructured. I don't recall hearing an announcement for seniors or families with babies/toddlers to board first. Likewise there is no boarding based on seating assignments. It still seemed to go fairly smoothly but we were near the front of the line and also seated up front on both flights so were on board and seated early. The flight out to Kahului was delayed about 1/2 hour (may have been longer) due to a passenger being detained at US immigration and subsequently the airline had to remove her luggage from the plane. While we were waiting to depart the head FA requested two passengers from the first 6 rows volunteer to move to seats at the back of the plane (failing volunteers two passengers would have been selected and asked to move). Seats were comfortable with lots of leg room. IFE cut out after being airborne for about 1/2 hour after which it was movies only for 5.99. Gone are the days of free entertainment and meals. Free snacks (cookies bits & bites) and soft drinks tea coffee etc provided. Leaving Kahului was also straight-forward with no long lineups at check-in. Flight was smooth and again the FAs were friendly and helpful. Flight schedules both ways were good leaving YVR at 9:40 AM and leaving Kahului at 2:05 PM so nothing extreme either way. Baggage unloading at OGG was fairly quick but YVR seemed to take a very long time.

That flight was cancelled and we ended up spending 11 1/2 hours in the Calgary airport. There was no apology or explanation from WestJet. While they did provide meal vouchers. Considering I was expecting a 2.5 hour flight and it ended up taking nearly 14 hours I would hope that WestJet would have a customer service representative to talk to. When I called the Super Centre I was told that there was no one for me to speak to and I should use their feedback section on their web page. I asked the agent how long I could expect to wait to receive a reply and I was told approximately 5 weeks. This is totally unacceptable. WestJet will be my last choice as an airline from this point forward.,,,Economy,,,,,,,,,1.0,0

Not much price difference between Westjet and Air Canada vacations. YYC to YYZ leg uneventful check in cheerful and helpful. T3 has more places to eat with good service. Flight was okay cheery cabin crew. Paid extra for exit row when it used to be reserved for tallest passengers. Irks one to see a 5'3 person in there when you have tried to book it. The sandwiches were not bad all other snacks were junk food. No entertainment system to or from CCC but it is sat TV. Westjet staff in Cuba superb. Only real beef is no direct WJ flights YYC-Caribbean. The stop in Toronto is a pain.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,T Lyons,United States,2011-01-21,"GIG-POA. Service on flight was fine seat space good but as their flights seem to consist of multi-stop flights down the Atlantic when the flight was delayed at the beginning it accumulated into a 2.5 hour delay and as Infraero provides the staff for check-in the only WebJet employees disembarked on the plane just to check us in. We spent an hour and a half just with the flight displayed as ""delayed"" then the flight arrived 30 minutes later than it had delayed. The embittered passengers did form a sort of camraderie and the airline staff were profusely apologetic (although as noted they do not offer alcoholic beverages with which to reward us). The price was almost half of TAM or Gol (one-way was around R$100/US$60) and the planes themselves were well kept and quite comfortable. Don't know if this was just a bad day or not its just a very small low-budget carrier.",,,Economy,,4.0,,,,,,,4.0,0

I haven't flown Westjet in a number of years but I would say that their offering is comparable to Air Canada economy class. All three flights were more or less on time and trouble free. Seat pitch feels similar to Air Canada. I didn't purchase any food so can't offer an opinion on this. Air Canada's inflight entertainment is somewhat superior - they offer a wider variety of audio and video entertainment gratis while Westjet offers certain TV channels for free and premium programming (Movies and certain TV programs) at additional cost (there is a slot to swipe a credit card in the seatback to pay for this). I did find it annoying that the channel displaying the aircraft's position (a personal favorite) was 80% Westjet advertising and only 20% map. Overall I find the offerings of the two airlines to be quite similar and wouldn't hesitate to fly Westjet over Air Canada if they offered a lower fare or a more convenient itinerary.,,,Economy,,8.0,,,,,,,4.0,1

Hassle free departure from Terminal 3 at Pearson (unlike Terminal 1 with understaffed US customs and brusque security staff). Outbound flight on equipment that felt aged with cheery staff relentlessly pushing whatever food they are selling. Tiny TV screens on back of each seat negate considering paying $5.99 to ruin watching a movie. Free TV programs for those who care. Return was in a brand new 737-800 that was not equipped with ANY in flight entertainment system as it had not been outfitted with such yet. One was advised to purchase reading material before one boarded. For a no frills airline it compares well to Southwest in its attitude and service and makes Air Canada look very overpriced indeed if one can substantially save on the fare on the same route as I did.,,,Economy,,8.0,,,,,,,4.0,1

Not a good first impression when Webjet had to transfer all passengers to Galeao Airport as their B733 couldn't land at Santos Dumont due to bad weather even though other airlines were operating. The genuine smiling crew made up for this though. All other flights left within a few minutes of scheduled time. Legroom a little tight but nothing too bad. Cabin crews invariably very friendly and welcoming. They appear to enjoy their jobs - I overheard one lady in particular discussing the company with an elderly passenger who hadn't flown with them before and she was very knowledgeable and was marketing the company well. Small snacks and complimentary drinks served on all sectors. Ground crew friendly and informative too.

Decent fares no surcharges transparent rules frequent promotions. Very friendly and efficient staff both on the ground and aboard; one can see they were very well trained and enjoy their work - a rarity today. Immaculate plane inside (in spite of a few worn paint spots on the fuselage) seat pitch better than in Gol or TAM. Announcements in English for foreign travelers. Food is a cold sandwich small but not microscopic and a small sweet - both very good. No alcohol but plenty of soft drinks fruit juices and mineral water. Punctuality was impressive - not a single flight delayed on the airport panels on both legs. The only real minus I saw was a very long time on the ground in stops (50-60 minutes) while one waits inside. My flights were nonstop but were it not so I'd be annoyed with that.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Sue Parkinson,United Kingdom,2008-04-22,An excellent trip with Silverjet to Dubai - the lounge was a wonderful haven and the check-in process really can't be beaten. On-board the seat was comfortable if somewhat narrow but no rival for BA CW or Virgin UC - however as fares can be more similar to their premium economy products it really is fantastic for what you are paying. Other small things - the on-board entertainment was a little limited and would have benefited from more variety and the central tables could have done with being a little wider to accommodate the consoles. My main criticism would be the time it took to serve the food on the night flight to Dubai - given that it's a relatively short flight taking 2 hours to serve the food really isn't acceptable as this leaves very little time for sleep. Perhaps Silverjet could consider taking food bookings during the check-in process and have the food heated up ready for departure. Having said that the food was tasty certainly better than some of the appalling meals found in Virgin UC. The lounge in Dubai was very crowded when we arrived and didn't have the greatest selection of food or drink but the immigration process was at least stress free - as long as you are not the last to be getting your passport back. It was pleasing to see that the plane was nearly full - and seemed to contain a mix of business and leisure passengers. I hope Silverjet succeed as despite the niggles they really were a wonderful way to travel.,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,1
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Peter Baynham,United Kingdom,2008-04-12,Luton to Dubai return. Don't rely on the Silverjet car service to pick you up in Dubai they admitted to me after it failed to show up at my hotel that they were having problems with it. Also seats do not fold fully flat and if you are tall like me difficult to get comfortable. At Dubai the aircraft sometimes has to park a long way from the VIP terminal and means a long bus ride. Terminal too small it has to hold arriving and departing passengers at the same time so you may not have anywhere to even sit. Terminal at Luton quite crowded not always easy to find a seat. A disappointing experience if you have paid the full flexi fare price. If you have got a saver ticket then fair value.,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,1
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Matthew Furneaux,United Kingdom,2008-04-12,I've just endured a night of going nowhere except a 2 hour flight over the English countryside. The Dubai flight was due to depart at 2155 and we boarded on time. We then sat on the plane for 3 hours while a fault was fixed. I should say at this point that the crew were excellent and served us all whatever we wanted from the bar and did their best to provide information. When we finally took off the pilot soon broke the news that the fault had re-occured during take off and we had to return to Luton after burning off some fuel hence the flight going no-where. When back on the ground at 0400 the ground crew really tried their best to provide options but when you have such a tiny fleet these options didnt include transfering to another plane sadly. And that sums up Silverjet I think. When it works it really is fantastic. When there are problems although the staff are first class they simply do not have the infrastructure to properly deal with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,1

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Nick Langford,United Kingdom,2008-04-04,Luton to Dubai. Great experience with Silverjet to Dubai. At Luton we chose valet parking and left the car outside the door of the Silverjet lounge. Lounge at Luton is great better than BA club lounges. The plane was 90% full which was good to see because Silverjet deserve to succeed. At Dubai you get off the plane  bus to VIP terminal sit down in the lounge while they stamp your passport and then you leave luggage lined up outside ready to go in the car! ten times better that the usual Dubai terminal experience. Return flight was very relaxed cabin crew excellent. food was very good. got off the plane at Luton walked to baggage reclaim  cases already there walked out of terminal to find car waiting 50 m from the door. Excellent! My only criticism would the poor selection on the inflight entertainment but that is certainly not a big deal. I would recommend Silverjet for Dubai over Virgin Emirates or BA. I still have my luggage!,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,1
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Leon Mills,United Kingdom,2008-04-03,LUT - EWR Return. My second round trip to the US with Silverjet in 6 months.This time around I used the transfer taxis from Parkway station there was one waiting and I was transferred to the terminal immediately. Lounge and check in at Luton once again a unique experience. I would recommend that you put your US first night address via the online check in I think it just makes the whole process even more straightforward in the lounge as the staff literally just have to get your boarding card. Outbound there were pre-flight drinks and the seat was fine. I worked for 5 hours using the in seat power for my laptop. Inbound I was on the late flight but it turned out they had cancelled the earlier flight and so combined the two so the late flight was full all but 4 seats. As mentioned previously this places a bit of a stretch on the Newark lounge. On board I spotted some empty seats behind me and asked if they could be used but was told there were not working properly they later sprung to life and I was moved to two empty seats enabling me to spread out. Overall another excellent Silverjet experience. The day after I got back I read in the business news that they haven't yet posted a profit but have made their lowest loss so far after flying for just over a year.,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,1
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,A Miller-Chan,United Kingdom,2008-04-01,I flew with my four and a half year old daughter on the 10am flight to Newark. This was our 3rd flight with Silverjet. As our previous experience with them was so exceptional; and we had a very tight three night turnaround; we opted once again to fly with them. My husband drove us through a blizzard to the terminal on the morning of the flight. As we expected there was a delayed take-off due to the need for de-icing. The ground crew were delightful and allowed my husband to join us for coffee before we boarded. Once onboard I enquired about the child pack for my daughter. I was told that you now give these out in the terminal. Flight crew were very apologetic and I was assured that one would be waiting for us upon arrival and it was! The last 45 minutes of the flight were extremely turbulent. I have never been sick during air travel before but actually became hideously sick during landing. I was terribly embarrassed and also concerned for my daughter as I knew she was frightened. The cabin crew were all so supportive kind and reassuring. They were professional and helped my daughter as well. I was met at the plane with a wheelchair by a wonderful young woman. She took care of everything right up until I got into the town car and reassured my young daughter all the way through. On our return to Newark for the 7:30 return flight to Luton we were greeted by the same young woman who had assisted me and the other ground crew. We were greeted by name and asked how I was feeling. The flight to Luton was excellent and I my daughter and I both slept for 5 hours. We arrived early to Luton and it was wonderful to be able to return to the terminal where we were greeted once again by name! Is the lounge or the seat as good as Virgin upper no; but the service and check in is superior. One thing to note is how child friendly they are. Silverjet now offers a child discount on all tickets as well. I am looking forward to my next flight with them in July.,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,1

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,A Murray,United Kingdom,2008-03-17,LTN-EWR Return. We just flew this airline for the first time and can strongly recommend it. We caught a train (frequent service) to Luton Parkway from central London and were transferred to the Silverjet terminal by complimentary taxi. All relatively straightforward. Check in was the best I have ever experienced- staff take your passport and whilst you sit in the lounge enjoying breakfast they complete the check in procedure. Very stress free. Our outgoing flight was an hour late in departing due to adverse weather conditions but passengers were kept updated and the pilot himself came into the lounge to introduce himself and explain what was happening. This was representative of the whole experience - staff friendly (they ask onboard how you wish to be addressed) and courteous but informal which is a very pleasant departure from other airlines I have been on. Food was better on the outbound leg and the departure lounge in New York is a little small but overall this was one of the best airline experiences I have ever had and despite the inconvenience of leaving from Luton will certainly be using them again. Re previous comments about passenger numbers - our flights were both running at about 80% full - I only hope that this continues to improve as this airline deserves to succeed.,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,1
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,B Greenberg,United States,2008-02-27,EWR-LTN return. I strongly recommend Silverjet. The check-in procedure is a revelation. No check- in counters Silverjet staff takes your baggage and passports invites you to sit in their private lounge and bring you your boarding pass. Onboard service was excellent. Seats extend to flat but not to fully horizontal. On evening flight from NY food service was quick allowing an overnight sleep. Both flights approximately 75% full. Luton Airport may be a bit far from London compared to Heathrow but with the expedited boarding at Silverjets private terminal the total time door to departure is the same. This is biz class for less than half the price of the majors. Give it a try.,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,1
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,J Morris,United States,2008-02-21,LTN-DXB. Check-in and boarding at Luton was incredibly easy and personal and the private terminal was very comfortable and spacious with very nice shower facilities (food not worth mentioning). This makes up for the headache of accessing Luton airport from Central London. Onboard food was below par. The cabin although comfortable and new was nearly empty on this flight. Arrival at the VIP terminal in itself almost makes the entire trip worth it as there is no hassle or waiting in Dubai's notorious passport control queues. However there was some confusion in finding where to go as this is currently the only commercial airline that uses this terminal and Silverjet staffing here was sparse. After wandering into a private waiting area a few of us were ushered upstairs by a non- Silverjet employee to the correct facility. Agents casually take your boarding passes and return them to you as you relax in the very upscale facility. However their Dubai lounge inconveniently lacks shower facilities and the staff is not subtle about rushing you out as they have shift focus to greeting departing passengers going back to Luton. Silverjet has some issues to iron out but overall is a product worth giving a try.,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,1

I loved the fact there's no announcement to the gate - just someone politely informing you which door to go through. Inflight experience equally superb - even being asked how I wished to be addressed by FA; and proper food/wine. Newark's a great airport - efficiently through Immigration (don't think there was a dedicated lane though??) and although the Lounge is not as good as Luton it's still great and you still get a quick easy check- in and great service.

As others have said the Newark lounge is not as nice (it's comparable to many other business lounges but not as good as the one at Luton).

I felt the crew were not as experienced as an airline like BA but they were very friendly. Meals tasty. I appreciated the personal space in a cabin that's all business class. A small point but there were no trolleys. Everything was served individually from the galley on a tray which felt more special. Inflight amenity kit was disappointing presumably a money saver. Luton surprised me as an excellent airport or at any rate the Silverjet terminal which is outside the main terminal. Check in at Luton and at Newark was at the entrance to the Silver Lounge close to where the taxi drops you off. I thought this arrangement was much better than queuing at desks with other airlines. Silver Lounges had snacks and drinks available including champagne and a good selection of magazines and newspapers and Luton had its own security channel which was hassle free.

My first experience with them was arriving with my wife at STN last year to hear of the last minute cancellation of our IAD flight due to supposed mechanical failure (underbooking more likely). We were immediately flown out to NYC on Virgin Upper Class from LHR after an M25 dash and transferred to Washington on the next day following a dreadful overnight stop near JFK. Our return flight from IAD was excellent in every respect. Having taken up our initial experience with their PA department on our return I heard from them three weeks later - with an offer of two free return flights to anywhere on their network. We took this up in June for a California flydrive via LAS. Outward flight was again excellent in every respect and Stansted was a revelation - but Maxjet let themselves down with a 3 hour delay at LAS on the way back because of a glitch over catering equipment that left them with the need to wash and sterilise the set used on the outward flight. Once we were in the air it was the usual good standard. Had they not gone under we would almost certainly have flown with them again.,,,,,4.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,R Hayes-O'Connor,United Kingdom,2007-12-24,The Luton experience could not be beaten. We arrived at the Silverjet terminal having pre-booked valet parking. We were met kerbside and invited into the terminal whilst the baggage was unloaded. It took no more than two minutes for the bags to be tagged and the cars keys taken care of and then we were off to the lounge. I would recommend taking breakfast in the lounge prior to the 10.00 departure to Newark. Check in was completed over a coffee in the lounge and the staff changed our original seats to better accomodate our party. From lounge to a/c via a bus was hassle free. On board the crew were very friendly and attentive. The seat was comfortable but mine would not recline fully. As it was a day flight this was not an issue. The in flight entertainment via your own portable screen is great until you want to keep watching a movie whilst dining. There isn't enough room for two screens and two laid up dining positions. We decided to share one screen. The toilets on board are clean but a little functional for a business class service. The food was very good although the pre arrival snack into Newark was very average. the cabin crew were attentive throughout the flight. At Newark we were off the flight and through customs in less than 20 minutes. Our friend in Newark was waiting for us in the Silverjet lounge having been invited to wait for us there. Our return flight was as hassle free as the outbound journey. Other comments on this site cover the lounge at Newark. Crew were again very friendly and professional. Food was again very good although breakfast a little disappointing. The angled lie flat seat was a little uncomfortable for me but everyone else seemed to be sleeping. Arrival into Luton faultless. We were sat in the car bags loaded within 30 minutes of the aircraft landing. The car was parked 50 yards from the terminal when we arrived. The Silverjet staff brought the car to the door of he terminal and loaded the luggage whilst we waited inside. Punctuality in both directions very good. The bottom line is that this is a good product for the price we would certainly use Silverjet again and would recommend them.,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,1
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Bill Harvey,,2007-12-20,Stansted to Vegas return - I was worried when Maxjet shares were suspended the day before my outbound flight. But both flights were punctual food good liberal quantities of champagne comfortable seats very reasonable prices. The plane was only half-full so I had a double seat to myself. Staff were helpful though seemed new to their jobs - I could see them reading from the manual as they made various announcements. I can't compare to full- price business class but compared to economy transatlantic flight this was an excellent way to travel for not a great deal more money. I hope Maxjet survive their financial hiccup because the service was excellent and I'd like to travel with them again.,,,,,5.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Stuart Hawksworth,,2007-12-20,Stansted to Las Vegas return. Check-in fast track security and lounge were excellent at Stansted. Service and food on the flight was good (better food than Continental Business First out of Birmingham). Seats old but comfortable and did not mind manual controls. Outbound there was a lingering smell from the toilets in the mid section which the crew sprayed with air freshener a couple of times. Check-in was very good at Las Vegas - no massive line - and the lack of lounge was no big deal given the cost of the tickets. Inbound was a good flight very pleasant crew and altogether a great experience. A much better product than premium economy with other airlines.MAXjet Airways - by Steven Neerkin,,,,,5.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,A Brathole,United States,2007-12-20,The whole setup at Luton with a private security channel is very convenient and about as hassle free as an airport experience can be these days. The Luton lounge is decent enough at least on par with an average business class lounge but not nearly in the same league as the Virgin Clubhouse at Heathrow. The Newark lounge is just a partitioned area in the arrivals hall without its own bathrooms etc so left a little to be desired. Also the security at Newark is just the standard lane shared with other airlines. In flight experience was similarly a slightly mixed bag. The flight attendants were friendly but seemed rather inexperienced and the food service was not particularly impressive. But the seat provided a good level of personal comfort which is really what matters most on a long flight. It had a continuous range of adjustments from upright to various reclining angles to (almost) flat and was more than adequate for getting some good sleep. I preferred this to the more plush Virgin Upper seats where the lie-flat design offers no positions between a limited initial reclining range and being turned fully flat. Overall the airline left you with the feeling that they are not quite as slick and professional as they would like you to think as some aspects of the end to end service package seemed a little half baked and improvised. But the positives easily outweighed the minor shortcomings and the bottom line is a great value for the money.,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,1
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,J Gregson,United Kingdom,2007-12-20,Luton to Dubai. Punctuality good service in the lounge was excellent inflight food very good and overall general service great. Seat doesn't recline to flat but I easily managed to get sleep. The lounge at the executive jet terminal in Dubai is a little cramped however the hassle free experience of using that terminal rather than the main one in Dubai is great. My only negative points are that on arriving at Luton Parkway I didn't see any of the Silverjet free taxis and got a wet walking from the bus stop to the Silverjet Terminal. But both are minor points and I will be using Silverjet again on this service.,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,1
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,P Naylor,,2007-12-11,STN-LAS-STN. Overall a very pleasant experience. STN check-in is quick and the Fast-track through security a bonus. The lounge at the boarding gate is a little small. Aside from that it offers all the standard biz-class trimmings. On time departures in both directions we also well received. The 767 cabin is bright and spacious. The website 'tour' of it doesn't do it justice. The seats are very comfortable enabling a comfortable nap but they do not recline to horizontal. On board service is good and the food quality fine although the menu could have a little more variety. This is a better product than the various premium economy services available and I would use them again.,,,,,4.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,R Wilson,United Kingdom,2007-12-10,I flew Silverjet last Sunday - late leaving my home in Richmond and was sure I was going to be late getting to Luton airport. I arrived 25 minutes before the flight was due to leave and the process could not have been smoother. There was no check in - they took my bag gave me a cup of coffee and brought my boarding card in the lounge. I was onboard 15 minutes after getting out of my car (which they parked for me!). Food was simple but really tasty. Seat very comfortable. The lounge at Newark is small but they have the same check in and boarding process (although security was shared with a BA flight).,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,1
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,John Henshaw,,2007-12-07,We have just returned from our first trip on Maxjet STN Las Vegas return. A few more comfortable seats at STN would have been appreciated as we were sharing with a JFK flight and the room was pretty full also a facility at Vegas would have been a bonus. However the fast track check in at Stansted facilities of the lounge punctuality of the flights comfort and legroom willingness and friendliness of staff and quality of the food could not be faulted. Excellent service and value for money.,,,,,5.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,A Solum,United Kingdom,2007-11-30,I give them very high marks for product and service - the only let-down is the seat not going 180-degree flat - which hinders sleep a bit as I tend to slide down. The leg rest is firm and presses on my feet but after all these flights I've worked out a solution - sleeping on my front and I don't seem to slide. Service is great food delicious. Canapes menus done by Le Caprice restaurant in London meal service served properly (no tray service) excellent breads and more. Top of the list goes for lounge at Luton - a haven of comfort. It removes the airport experience and passengers board in a calm and relaxed manner. I understand that EWR lounge is being improved. Only once have I had immigration lines at EWR (and this was due to a computer glitch) never any security issues - another huge boon in using this airline. Improvements and changes are constantly being introduced including better wines different catering re-designed lavatories availability of toothbrush & paste etc. Being a small carrier they can easily react to customer feedback and change things quickly. Great value for money with good levels of friendly service and comfortable seating equals a winning proposition for me! My last flights were 99 out of 100 pax outbound 76 out of 100 inbound - so good loads. From disembarking at LTN last month to car = 17 minutes. Speedy. From landing it was all of 26 minutes.,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,1
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,I Ponton,United Kingdom,2007-11-30,Silverjet LTN to EWR and very impressed with the service. Great seat good IFE and excellent food. The angled flat seat was good for at least 3 hours sleep. The crew were friendly and very attentive. The only points that I think need addressing are the toilets need sprucing up they don't look like toilets on a business class only service and more storage - teres nowhere to store anything around your seat. Apart from these minor points Silverjet is well worth the money and their private lounge at LTN is brilliant and very easy.,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,1
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Alan Stamp,,2007-11-27,"Returned from Las Vegas and found the experience a revelation compared to economy class. The leg room is very good (60"" seat pitch) with nearly flat seats (160 degrees). The lounge at Stansted was very good and would have been appreciated at Las Vegas where there is not a lounge. Food much better quality than economy. Service on the return flight a little slow due to training of new personnel but not bad enough to ruin the experience. Overall very good value for what you pay and I would not hesitate to recommend this airline to anyone as a superior and cost efficient alternative to economy or prem/economy with major airlines.",,,,,4.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Peter Park,,2007-11-27,"JFK to STN. The good - easy and efficient check-in (check in opens at JFK at 4:00 PM for 8:15 PM flight); Good lounge shared with other airlines - good food and amenities and beverages; Good escort through ""fast track"" security - basically you go to head of reguar security line; Good seats - a little dated but quite comfortable with perhaps 80% recline; Good but not great food served tray style - not like mainstream business airlines. Skip the greasy 3 cheese omelet for breakfast Fruit plate is a better choice.The ""not quite up to business class"": Crew do not work as a team and appear not to have worked together before; Plane is a little dated (we got the one that had been with some Asian airline given the signs in Chinese characters as well as English) We were kept informed of delay updates (see below) but helpful staff coordinator suffered from lack of information from others. The bad: Captain did not show up but either the original one or another was flown in from Charlotte NC while we waited -- 8:15 PM takeoff became 11:45 takeoff. Would I fly MaxJet again? Yes at the $521 (including taxes) one way fare The key is what others have posted: If you are used to mainstream airline business class you will be disappointed but if economy or premium economy is your experience you will be impressed.",,,,,4.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Arron Zubier,United Arab Emirates,2007-11-27,Just flew in this morning on their new service from Luton to Dubai and being a Silverjet first timer I have to say I had a great flight. Being 6ft and of large build I have yet to be able to sleep for anything more than 20mins or so on a flight imagine my delight at having slept for 5.30hrs. The ground crew at Luton very friendly and professional and crew a delight. I think the toilets on board could do with some modernising as they do not reflect the feel of the rest of the plane. Silverjet for me is way to go now when flying London-Dubai and vice versa.,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,1
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Derek Hill,,2007-11-12,"Las Vegas to Stansted Be warned there is no Maxjet lounge at Vegas - and no lounge-sharing arrangement.

One of their managers at Vegas told me in response to my complaint that they have been trying for over a year to get some space! Otherwise the trip was satisfactory. I've used them several times before for the STN-JFK-STN route but they always let themselves down with the catering - certainly not the ""gourmet"" meals that they claim.

STN to JFK was excellent: fast track security then free drinks and food in the Maxjet lounge. On the plane the cabin crew were attentive and efficient plane left on time food was nice and we arrived 20 minutes early.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Maurice Frankel,United Kingdom,2007-11-09,LTN-EWR-LTN. just flew Silverjet for the first time. Having read the various customer reviews prior to my trip one of the most pleasing thing was to see that various complaints had been addressed by the company i.e. the toilets onboard appear to have been refurbished; ambient temperature onboard certainly was not too high; leaving Newark we had use of the fast track security channel. I found the flight times very convenient. Furthermore there are few flights arriving into Terminal 2 Newark at the same time so security was a wizz. Similarly we arrived back into Luton after the early morning rush so again no waiting. I noticed that a good proportion of the people on the return flight had been with me on the outward journey and i think that this is where Silverjet really scores best as the alternative full fare economy or premium economy is far inferior. If you look at Silverjet as an alternative to BA Club or Virgin Upper you will be disappointed simply because that seats are not comfortable enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,1

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Alistair Mutch,,2007-11-06,"I was due to fly from Stansted to Washington and the flight never got off the ground after them keeping us in the lounge for 5 hours. The ground crew were polite and worked hard to help us but it was clear they were struggling. We were all shipped off to LHR for a Virgin flight (the only partner they have for transfers it would appear) the next morning. They organised taxis hotel and dinner as well as tickets for VS next morning. When I arrived at Virgin next morning they did not have our tickets just as well I left plenty of time. They got some people into Upper some into Premium Economy and the rest (me included) were offered Economy and ""2 free return tickets on MaxJet as compensation"" - I figured this would let my long suffering wife have a moment of luxury and selected this as they had also run out of Upper tickets ! I have now been chasing these elusive tickets for some 2.5 months 3 emails 5 calls constant promises but no action or return call. Shortly I will lose patience and visit the airport to confront them. The return flight was 5 hours late due to ""a technical fault on the place"" and they had to move the NY flight out to pick us up. They appear to have no spare capacity at all and a number of old worn 767 units. Other aspects of the flight food was okay service polite seat excellent I would use it if it was reliable but judging from comments in the lounge from other travellers it might not appear so. Add to that the crummy post sales service handling a problem and I cannot recommend them if you need the route for business. Allow for error it would seem likely based on evidence. Sad good idea polite people on the ground under funded poor service record. I only hope that if they do go out of business that this does not stop other people executing this idea more effectively.",,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,J Barr,United Kingdom,2007-11-06,Luton-Newark-Luton. I found this for the money an excellent service with just a few niggles. Plus points are the really excellent and stylish lounge at Luton; the quick and simple check-in and boarding procedure there; polite and enthusiastic staff on the ground and in the cabin; the food and its presentation; and general impression of stylishness and design. Personally I find Luton perfectly accessible from central London: trains from Blackfriars (London Bridge Farringdon and Kings Cross are other stops) every 20 minutes or so and a cab to the terminal. There is simply no comparison between the check-in and security experience with Silverjet at Luton and Heathrow or Gatwick whatever the airline and however elevated the class. The niggles: though I had printed out my confirmation and several other web pages my computer packed up a day or so before I left and I could neither check in online nor order a car from Newark to Manhattan. I tried to ring Silverjet to arrange the latter but could find no telephone number on the website; obtained the number from new unimproved directory enquiries but despite my 'phoning several times at various hours over the next two days no-one ever answered. When I checked in they agreed to send an e-mail requesting this but it was almost as if this was an innovative and brilliant solution! I did not find the non-availability of duty-free shopping at Luton any problem - it's the quid pro quo for the private channel: but prospective passengers should be aware of this indeed the website (otherwise informative re the terminals) should state it. I am also quite happy not to have duty-free goods flogged in flight. Arriving at Luton Parkway on a filthy wet day no taxis were evident and none of the station staff seemed to have heard of the Silverjet-branded free taxis as advertised (this despite the fact that they obviously pull up or wait in front all day). A very scruffy and decrepit minicab eventually showed up - quite a way from the canopied forecourt and then a silver 'black' cab. The procedure was not obvious and I got very wet. At Newark I had to wait about 20 minutes in the rather crowded Silverjet lounge before my car came: the ground staff were not efficient in locating me. On that subject I agree with the comments of many other passengers that the Newark lounge is inadequate: but this seems to be a feature of all US so-called premium lounges and no doubt Silverjet has had to be grateful for what it can get. Also Luton sets a very high standard for comparison. Immigration at Newark was amazingly quick for the US and courteous and friendly: and the baggage was already on the carousel. I would agree also that the seat is not as comfortable as it looks especially when reclined (too short and not flat as people have noted). Still pretty good for the money. The outward flight in particular was very lightly loaded with the rear cabin almost unoccupied. Pleasant though it is to fly without crowding I do hope that they get higher load factors or they will not be in business much longer. I do hope there is no truth in the suggestions that flights are cancelled for lack of sufficient passengers - there is no way one is prepared to risk this happening. I would give a 5 but for the niggles and really do hope Silverjet succeeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,1
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,M Harwood,,2007-11-03,I have to say how terribly disappointed we all are having had to cancel our vacation to the USA for next year. We live in London very near to Stansted and were excited about travelling from there rather than Gatwick. Our plans involved Washington DC. We booked our seats early May. I specifically asked about the Washington flight and I have an e-mail guarantee this would not be suspended again. Lies. Suddenly by e-mail not even personally addressed to me I receive notification that our flights home have been cancelled. Offered the alternative of JFK. However we had plans to fly on from Vegas which was our first stop over to Florida and then fly up to Washington for a weekend visit. Our internal flight and hotel was booked on a non-refund basis. So we have lost money big time because of Maxjet Airways. I asked Maxjet for compensation regarding this but all they would offer was $100 per person and then we needed to get to JFK instead. Result = cancellation of flight from Florida to IAD lost £550 ($1000+) - cancellation of Washington weekend hotel & trips £600 ($1200+). We would then need to book a Jet Blue flight from Florida into JFK currently costing $319 per person (total £850 or $1941). Sadly we could not afford all this with just $600 compensation from Maxjet - so our plans are over finished. Maxjet took ages to refund our original ticket price. Reliability and honesty is the key for success. Judgement is out on Maxjet as far as I am concerned. Back to Virgin Atlantic from now on.,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,0

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,H Ridgwell,United Kingdom,2007-10-31,Our first flight with Silverjet and a fantastic experience. Arrived at Luton terminal and had the car whisked away with valet parking - not sure where they park the car but it had 12 miles on the clock when it was returned. The lounge was quite packed but there was still room to sit and relax. Onboard we found the seat comfortable. The aircraft are showing their age but on the whole it was quite clean and tidy the cabin temperature was way to high and found it difficult to sleep comfortably on the return flight. The food and wine on board was excellent and cabin crew good. The lounge at Newark was disappointing and a bit small for a full business flight - we had trouble finding some where to sit together. For someone who has never experienced business class before this is the airline that everyone should try.,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,1
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Elizabeth King,United States,2007-10-31,EWR-LTN-EWR - I decided to give Silverjet a try as I had to make a quick trip to London for a 1 day conference and was not looking to spend the $5000 Continental (my normal carrier) was asking for biz class. I live within 15 minutes of EWR so the perk of only needing to arrive 45 minutes prior to boarding was a huge plus for me. When I arrived at the terminal and finally found the lounge I was a little concerned about what the flight would be like. The lounge is really just a section of the arrivals area that has been cordoned off with a movable temporary wall. There was very little space even though the flight was less than half full but the staff were very accomodating. Boarding went smoothly and we were off exactly on time. I found this to be one of the most relaxing flights I have ever experienced. I will give some of that credit to the half full flight which allowed me to have an empty seat next to me. The seats are pretty narrow as is the arm space between them so I'm not sure how much I would have liked it if anyone but a loved one was sitting next to me. The food was shockingly good - I had the vegetarian option. I managed a good 4 hours sleep which is a record for me. The seats were quite comfortable for sleeping and the blanket was great. Had the chauffeur service in LTN - slight problem trying to locate the driver but it was rectified quickly - transport was a huge and not very comfortable van as opposed to the sedan it should have been. Return - the LTN lounge is really wonderful - one of the better lounges I've been to. Again flight boarded and departed on time. Service was very good food delicious - enjoyed a few glasses of wine and caught up on some movies and decided that I loved Silverjet.,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,1

The plane appeared tired and old and in need of a good cleaning. The crew was pleasant but so disorganized it was almost comical to watch. They appeared to need a good training class! The food was average. As previously noted it is very difficult to get in or out of your seat if you have a window seat and the person in front has the seat all the way down. The lounge in LAX was a little inconvenient but very spacious and comfortable. Check in was very easy with no lines! The return flight was on a newer plane and the crew was 100% better in their organization. This flight was about 80% full. Stansted lounge was convenient and well stocked. We would definitely fly Maxjet again because we loved the extra space semi-flat seats and the price was right. The fear of cancellation is the only major obstacle so we will always add time on both ends of our trip. We would rate them 3 stars outgoing and 4 stars on the return.,,,,,4.0,,,,,,,,0

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,K McKeggie,,2007-10-25,"Very Annoyed. Maxjet cancelled our flights (via e-mail) on Oct. 9 and they also cancelled the entire route (Stansted to Dulles) so that we couldn't rebook. They suggested an itinerary that would involve a 4.5 hour layover in JFK and a midnight arrival in DC. We're travelling with a 10 month old infant so this was impossible to contemplate on top of a long journey already. I wrote to ""customer care"" at Maxjet about this on Oct. 10 and also complained about the late notice. Our travel is less than a month from the cancellation date so now we have to scramble for flights and reasonable fares - not easy.

Outbound excellent with smooth checkin fast track security at Stansted and through to lounge. Very good lounge with great food and drinks. Flight left on time as plane was half full. Crew ok friendly enough but definitely not polished like BA. Way back was painful. Our reserved seats were given to a separate passenger but after my partner had a strop they were given back. Lounge at LAX is pretty awful. Flight left on time but it took 2 hours for dinner to arrive. Digiboxes are a pain. Not sure Maxjet will survive as the plane outbound was 50% full and the flight the day before was cancelled which occurs regularly. Still a better product than BA or Virgin premium class as its a lot cheaper and fantastic legroom. Could be a great product if they get it together and advertise their concept.,,,,,3.0,,,,,,,,0

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,T Wilson,,2007-10-22,Flew Maxjet to Los Angeles and back from Las Vegas have to say the experience was disappointing feel MaxJet jet offers economy class service with old fashioned business class seats. The cabin crew were the worst I have experienced. The digiplayer means you cannot use your tray for meals or work and watch the TV. No pre take -off drink first proper drink offered one hour after take-off meal took forever which on a night flight to wait two hours for the meal to be served is stupid we took off at 19.30 by 22.00 we were still only being offered the dessert. Breakfast was the same slow service and slow to take away the trays which made many of the passengers impatient. Shame as the quality of the food is very good. The basic problem is lack of interest by the cabin crew who seem to respond to people asking for what they want rather that actually knowing what people want. The cabin steward serving our side of the plane went down the isle serving one drink at a time - I had a glass of red my wife had glass of white he went to the front came back with my wife's white wine went back and came back with my red! Why no drinks trolley? If you wanted another glass it was not offered it had to be asked for.,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Gary King,,2007-10-22,Washington to London Stansted. Excellent check in then directed to Northwest lounge in terminal B which was packed out and only offered limited snacks and drinks. After the scheduled departure time had passed I requested an update from the rather miserable Northwest lounge agent who then told me that the flight was 1.5 hours late. So much for keeping your passengers informed. The flight finally boarded nearly 2 hours behind schedule. The aircraft a Boeing 767-200 is fitted out in a 2x2x2 business class configuration but was only about 50% full. The seats are of the old fashioned business class style so not lie flat but plenty of leg room. We departed for the active runway only to park up with the engines shut down due to adverse weather. So there we stayed parked up at the end of the runway for over 2 hours. The crew did what they could to keep us happy. We were served soft drinks and fizzy wine and were allowed to use our mobile phones. Eventually the aircraft was allowed to take off with a new flight plan whch avoided the bad weather. By that stage I decided to sleep for the rest of the flight and managed 5 hours kip with a reasonable degree of comfort. In the morning I enjoyed a light breakfast with tea prior to landing some 4 hours behind schedule. Maxjet offer a very good and well priced business class product but their timekeeping is questionable.,,,,,3.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Fraser Campbell,United Kingdom,2007-10-18,LTN-EWR Return. LTN private lounge excellent. Plenty of space despite full flight and all amenities expected. Onboard seating comfortable food good wine plentiful. Seat power wasn't working so digiplayer didn't work but rectified by competent crew with a battery. Planes show their age - despite this still very comfortable. On return the lounge at EWR lets the airline down. Comments from ground crew indicate difficulty with EWR in securing a suitable private terminal with cooperation of TSA. I was informed by TSA agent that I could not use the business class security fast track as Silverjet don't pay for it. The lounge at EWR is cramped but acceptable for a business class product. The joy of dropping your bags and being checked in while you sip champagne is still there and worth it. Flight back got 4 hours sleep - found enough space on the 6ft bed (I am 6ft and quite generously built). One adverse comment (it might be the age of the plane) but the temperature of the cabin was too high and the feeling of lack of oxygen was present on both flights.,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,1
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,John Barnes,,2007-10-16,STN-LAS return. Outbound prompt. Return flight delayed an hour by minor mechanical defect but kept advised by crew. Planes are tired and seats old but they are very comfortable and crew generally try very hard. May not be up to true business class but close and at the price you cannot complain. Only problem with LAS is Virgin Atlantic out of LGW. Depending on slots and delays (appear endemic on VA) Maxjet can arrive just behind a 747 full of passengers so immigration can be a nightmare. First time in many visits to US I've found immigration agent with personality and at pains to apologise for the delays due to VA! Similarly on return if the VA flight is delayed the LAS terminal 2 can become very crowded in the absence of separate lounge facility for Maxjet. Would be delighted to fly Maxjet again. See they have finally acknowledged defeat and cancelled their IAD service from next month.,,,,,4.0,,,,,,,,0

Outward lounge at Stansted very nice and check-in was painless. The flight was comfortable and service exceptionally friendly with very reasonable food. The return flight was not quite as good due to the lounge at Washington not being up to Stansted standard and the flight was delayed a couple of hours due to ""unscheduled maintenance"" However the seats were comfortable service friendly and we were able to sleep. This surely represents value for money and we will be using it again.",,,,,5.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,M Deba,,2007-10-16,"STN-LAS and back and have in the past used Maxjet to/from JFK. Delays on both outward (ex STN) flights of 5 and 2 hours respectively but both returns on time. Aircraft old but acceptable seats OK (typical 80's business class) and food only average (not gourmet). Beware pre-assigned seats can disappear for no apparent reason so it is still worth checking in early - our pre-booked seats were not booked when we checked in (despite being assigned when we checked a few days earlier) and handling agent unable to explain why. Tip - try and sit near the front the service often deteriorates the further you sit from the forward galley. Attitude of Manager at STN to seat problem very poor - big false smile on her face whilst she said ""seats are not guaranteed we have six aircraft which often change"". All the aircraft are 767's and even if configured slightly differently they all have a row 3! My biggest gripe is service on board. Whilst cabin crew in are friendly/polite they take an age to serve drinks each meal course clear up replenish drinks etc. On night flight LAS-STN last Thursday it was 4 hours after take off we got our last course and then waited an age for coffee - not good if you wanted to sleep second half. Unbelievably on a full flight there was just 1 cart serving the cheese/dessert and the coffees making very very slow progress down the aircraft from the front. I was in row 15 - so was getting very impatient. Other airlines run their meal service like a military operation and replenish empty wine glasses along the way routinely and often Maxjet crew faff about and make painfully slow progress. Then whilst this is going on you'll see many of the crew chatting in the front galley maybe clearing up but why not clear up on the second half of the flight when everyone has finished eating and will be asleep - giving the crew plenty of time to do what they want? And don't rely on the crew call button - I saw numerous attempts to attract crew's attention and on hearing the call button ""ping"" often the attendant(s) did not even look up yet alone look down the cabin to see who was calling. I tried six times to call them while I sat with an empty wine glass before someone bothered to respond. As I said - the crew are friendly and do try but they clearly need better training. It is not a ""number of crew to passenger"" ratio (though it is poor) because they are often standing chatting in the galley. People want a quicker meal service especially on night flights when they want to sleep later - and there is no reason why you should not have the opportunity to enjoy the full three courses plus a nightcap. MAXjet crew just need to focus and get organised with the meal service and get it done quicker - then pay attention to drinks replenishment. Overall comfortable seats reasonable entertainment (though the content of the digebox a bit dated) reasonable food quality (when you get it) but enjoyment of meal really spoiled by one hour wait (with empty glass) between courses. If you are used to flying economy or premium economy you may enjoy MAXjet but if you usually fly regular business class don't expect anything like the service or attention to detail you have become used to. That said - MAXjet is often much cheaper so it is up to you just know what to expect.",,,,,3.0,,,,,,,,0

The fact that it is also far less expensive alternative to premium economy is a nice bonus.

The seats were roomy and comfortable I didn't make a big deal on the fact that they're the old generation all I care was the fact they I could sleep. The meal was average airplane food we even had lobster tails on the way to London. Plenty of drinks. Both flights arrived on time. Good and responsive service from the flight attendants. The lounge in IAD is ok maybe too crowded the one in London was better. Check-in was fast could access reserved lane at security clearing inspections in no time. Plane 75% full on the way to London and 50% full on the way back to Washington. The only thing we hated was the long and slow line at the immigration in Stansted. Way too slow! We waited one hour in line before to be cleared. The 767 is a little too noisy airplane. I will use Maxjet again.,,,,,5.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,J Keller,,2007-10-04,"My wife has flown Maxjet a number of times and raved about onboard comfort and service. So I decided this time to fly with her IAD-STN instead of on United as I usually do. I had the opportunity to experience the main problem with Maxjet - our flight was cancelled on the day of departure. My wife was travelling on a free ticket from a previous flight which had been cancelled. Perhaps Maxjet's motto should be ""A superb experience - if you get off the ground"". It seems that cancellations are all too frequent on the IAD-STN route and always blamed on a ""maintenance problem"". I suspect however the real problem is lack of bookings. We were readily re-booked on Virgin Upper Class - a truly awful experience. My wife said the Maxjet service food drink and comfort were far above Virgin. Maxjet assured us we would have free ground transportation IAD-STN. I mentioned this at Virgin check-in at the Virgin Lounge and twice to the flight attendant and was assured that everything was ok. When I checked at the Virgin limo counter at LHR they had never heard of us and upon checking said we weren't entitled to transportation. Virgin could care less about solving our problem. I called the Maxjet UK number and apparently got a rep at the New York call center. She told me to go outside and get a Checker cab and tell the driver it was for Maxjet. I told her I was in London and had never seen a Checker cab there in the last 40 years! She didn't understand and disconnected me. We ended up renting a car at LHR instead of STN even though our destination was only 20 minutes from STN. Maxjet has great on-board service at a very good price - if you ever get a chance to experience it.",,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Jeremy Davies,,2007-10-04,"Just flew roundtrip STN to LAX for first time on MAXjet. As has been posted previously if you're a business class passenger looking for a deal forget it. If you're economy looking for a deal it's not bad. STN lounge is fine LAX lounge is a joke (being bused out from an airline gate to a business lounge made of prefabricatd buildings is so silly). The planes are old I checked my return plane's FAA details and found it was registered as built in 1985. The seats are the old fashioned mechanical ones toilets I experienced were not really clean cabin noise is surprisingly high and the overall impression is not so good. The service was OK they try hard but food no way ""gourmet"" it's what you'd expect from airline food.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Donald Whittle,,2007-10-04,Stansted to Dulles. Stansted lounge as good as others reported fast track etc. Only defect was 2 of the toilets were out of order but as the plane was half-full that wasn't a great handicap. All on time. Recommended Maxjet to several folk in Virginia especially musicians travelling to the Charlottesville Music Festival from Europe. But warned them of possible unreliability. Returning on 24th from Dulles - flight cancelled but an excellent and friendly check-in steward made sure we were on the Upper Class Virgin flight at 6.30 and arranged for transport to meet us at Heathrow and take us to Stansted. Virgin lounge even more luxurious and sampled the flat-bed system on way home. Our cab driver said he often did this run for Maxjet and another re-routed traveller had had both flights cancelled and re-scheduled. It sounded as if there had been more recent difficulties over parts/maintenance especially on the Dulles flight. Would certainly fly Maxjet again hoping for the best and keeping fingers crossed.,,,,,4.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Ewan Barr,,2007-09-22,"STN to LAS. Check-in a little slow but friendly fast-track through security and then into the lounge which was very busy due to the delayed LAX flight (although lounge being expanded). Service was very good as was food and general view is that this is great value for money. The planes are not that new but they seem well maintained and comfortable. My only gripe was that there were at least 3 passengers with young children and solo travellers such as myself all got asked to move around the aircraft to accomodate these passengers to have ""nicer seats"". I am usually happy to do this but one wonders why these people could not have got seats all arranged well in advance (particularly as the flight was not full). It did seem as if the staff were a little too eager to please but just a small moan. Overall a great product at a superb price. It looks like the LAS flights are more likely to be on time than others particularly the JFK flights",,,,,4.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Tracey Morrow,,2007-09-19,STN-LAS-STN. Outbound flight excellent. Good cabin crew and food was best we have had on an airline. Return flight delayed due to a member of staff calling in sick - a replacement had to be flown in from Los Angeles. Made me wonder what would have happened if the Los Angeles flight was not on the new roster! Flight home was also good. My concern with is the attitude to safety. I am used to British airlines who have a very strict policy with regards to safety but Maxjet did not ask passengers to be seated when the captain illuminated the seat belt sign. They also allowed an obviously inebriated passenger to sit in the exit seat which should not have been allowed.,,,,,4.0,,,,,,,,0

The only other problem was the Virgin flight arriving at LAS Sept 9 was 2 hours late and caused congestion at security. Same flight was 2 hours late again Sept 16.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,D McKenney,,2007-09-17,Dulles to Stansted return. We booked our tickets well in advance and paid $1000 each for the roundtrip flight. Check in at Dulles fine. They give you a ticket to go through the priority security screening which is nice. Maxjet uses the Northwest Lounge along with a couple other airlines so the lounge can get crowded. The lounge had the typical selection of drinks and snacks available. On entering the plane I thought the interior had seen better days. The flight was about half full so everyone was able to spread out. The seat was comfortable and a lot of space. I wish they had given a short brief on how to use the seat because I didn't know the leg rest could extend back and forth to fit the legs until the return flight (it's the big black lever in the armrest). My nine year old daughter was able to figure it out and she slept the entire flight. They handed out the digi players shortly after takeoff and started a meal service. I can't comment too much on the outbound service because I tried to sleep. The return leg from Stansted is where Maxjet shines. The check in was quick and fast track through security is great. We made it through security in about three minutes. Maxjet lounge in Stansted outstanding - wide selection of snacks/food as well as drinks. The service on the return flight was fine but it didn't seem as friendly as the first flight. The food was good but it was definitely airline food I think Maxjet is a little liberal using gourmet to describe the food selection. Maxjet is a great value for the money. The seats space lounge and priority security are well worth the price. It looks like they are upgrading the lavs. The interior of the planes are nice with new carpet and the seats are good condition. I look forward to flying Maxjet again in a couple of years.,,,,,4.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,David Ellis,United Kingdom,2007-09-15,LUT-EWR-LUT. Outward journey was thoroughly impressive from start to finish. The car valet service happened without a hitch and check-in was over in a minute. The Luton lounge is spacious and comfortable and the 95% occupancy for the flight seemed to be accommodated easily. Security was a breeze and the private bus service to the plane was efficient. On board staff were friendly and attentive throughout and really seemed to enjoy what they were doing. Food was actually as good as I've ever had on a business class flight and the individual attention given to preparing and plating up the food seemed to make a real difference. Immigration and baggage collection at Newark was efficient and our pre-booked chauffeured limo was pretty much ready and waiting. The return journey didn't start too well because of the overcrowding in the Newark lounge. The flight was again full apart from a few seats and the lounge couldn't handle this. I've heard that a new lounge is due to open soon but Silverjet haven't confirmed this. The Silverjet CEO was actually on the flight so hopefully he'll have realised first-hand how unacceptable the current situation is. Take-off was delayed by about an hour because of air traffic control issues. The service on board didn't seem quite as polished as the outbound flight and the food was only average. Sensibly Silverjet offer a two-course meal on the night flight so that one can get the maximum amount of sleep. As others have commented the seats are far from truly flat but comfort wise they're not bad and we both managed to get some sleep. Breakfast is a sort of on board 'take out' i.e. yohourt smoothie fruit and a choice of cheese and ham stuffed croissant or cream cheese bagel in a bag. Not really my ideal for breakfast but probably better than a ghastly reheated omelette and hash browns and certainly easier for the FAs to dispense 40 minutes before landing. Baggage handling at Luton again let the side down but the car valet service was as efficient as on the outward journey. Overall I'd rate Silverjet very highly; better then MAXjet not quite at the level of EOS but then it's half the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,1
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Rob Laughton,United States,2007-09-15,A brilliant way to travel. My wife and I went to New York for a 4-day romantic break and travel both ways was relaxed and comfortable. We booked the valet parking at Luton and this is how it works. You drive to the front door of the terminal get the bags out of the car and hand the keys over. Walk all of 20 yards to check-in where they take your bags and passports. Then walk a further 20 yards to the lounge for breakfast. A hostess brought our boarding cards to us about 10 minutes later. That was it. Flights both ways were full and on- time.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Justin St Barbe,,2007-09-05,Flew the inaugural flight STN-LAX. Considering we had press and the Maxjet Customer Service Director onboard service wasn't outstanding. The staff spent most of the trip in the rear galley chatting passed through the cabin 5 times (on an 11.5 hour flight) with water and juice for everything else you had to use the call bell. On one occasion a member of staff stood for 10 minutes chatting in the galley and passengers had to get up to get a glass of water rather than be served. The digeplayers had out of date content - last updated March 2007 and I managed to get through 5 sets due to battery life dying - fine as they had spares available as flight was about a quarter full not so great if no spares available! I asked the Purser if I could have the email address of the CEO who welcomed us on board and invited us to give some comments (he asked us to contact him personally with any comments) to be given a dressing down and then told to visit maxjet.com. Clearly she wasn't interested in any customer feedback. Really rather disappointing think I'll stick to UA next time.,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,0

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,A Anderson,,2007-09-01,We were standby customers for flights on MaxJet from Dulles to Stansted and Stansted to Dulles flights. We had no problems getting seats on the plane at the time of checkin. Was a little worried since they only have one flight a day but not problems. We had no issues with flights being cancelled. I will say that we left a little later than the scheduled time but we boarded on time so the delay could have been airport traffic. It was great to be served finger foods and champagne before takeoff. You get a salad with bread and your choice of an entree. It will depend which entree you get on how good it is. If you are flying to UK get the fish from UK get the chicken curry or salmon. Deserts are delicious. They also have a deal with the Radisson hotel in stansted so you can shower and eat breakfast buffet (if you have time of course before your connection flight).

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Margaret Lehmann,,2007-08-29,I recently traveled from Washington DC to Stansted with MaxJet. The flight over was not bad but I thought their gourmet meals were overrated. The trip back was a nightmare. My flight was cancelled and I was flown to JFK instead. I wouldn't have minded this if they had actually gotten me to Washington in time to catch my connecting flight. There was ample time given that the JFK flight was several hours earlier than the original flight. Instead I was given the run-around on the phone pre-flight at Stansted and at JFK as to how I was getting home. At JFK a rep from MaxJet assured us (I had found others who were in the same predicament) that we would be flown on Jet Blue to Washington. Everyone but me was. They couldn't find my name on some list even though I provided them with my confirmation number etc. Long story short I got home a day late having missed appointments and obligations.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Jeri Epstein,,2007-08-29,My husband and I flew from Washington Dulles to London and back in June. The 767 was broken and they substituted an Air Florida 737 with movable ottomans (possible projectiles) and the threat of a fuel stop in Gander. They crew was baffled. They didn't know how to work with the Air Florida crew. MaxJet knew the quality of the service was so far below what was advertised that they offered $500 per person rebated via coupon for future service. Three months later with multiple customer service contacts: not a dime. The return flight was on a 757 owned by the Dallas Mavericks. It was very luxurious and the Team Jet crew worked smoothly with the MaxJet crew. Bottom line: nice people working on a shoe-string with very uneven service.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,H McKenna,,2007-08-22,Stansted to Washington last Summer and a positive review. This year we booked Stansted to Las Vegas - what a drop in customer service in a year. Stansted lounge had a smaller range of food and drinks and was packed when we arrived. The crew onboard the outbound flight seemed to think that they were doing you a favour by serving you - the word condescending springs to mind. There were only 2 services this year - fewer than last year. You are expected to serve yourself if you want any snacks. Last year they brought them round to you every 15 minutes. On our return there is no lounge in McCarran airport and no drinks or food vouchers supplied. Again the crew were condescending in their service. I was told off by the purser as my table was at an angle and not directly in front of me. As it wasn't blocking the aisle I didn't see a problem. As others have mentioned the planes are old and it's a nuisance that the DVD player has to move when food is served. The service has gone way downhill in a year although the plane was full. I'd just returned from an economy flight with KLM to China and the service onboard KLM was better than that supplied by Maxjet. The only thing in it's favour is the extra seat width and length. Last year I was keen to book again. This year I'm not so sure.,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,0

The customer services said we had been booked premium economy seats with Virgin to Heathrow at roughly the same time and a taxi would meet us to take us over to STN to pick our car up. We were then transferred to a different terminal to catch the Virgin flight and told that Maxjet had only authorised economy seats for us - as opposed to their promise of premium economy. Maxjet staff basically said anything you wanted to hear in order to move you on quickly!

No reason given for cancellation and promised a visit from a Rep when we got to Heathrow. We had to find the extra cost to Heathrow for a start Virgin was not expecting us but rallied round and got us on a flight a no show of course from the Maxjet Rep and so far we have not received a reply to our complaint from Maxjet. I waited as long as I could before I was forced to write this review but it seems they dont really care whether you fly with them or not! Be ready for cancellations and delays and no customer service. On a plus side we did fly back as planned from Washington(delayed) but it was a very comfortable. We had 3/4 hours restful sleep and the service on board was very good. I just dont know if i can trust them enough to use them again which is a shame as it could be such a good service.,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,P Simpson,,2007-08-08,STN to JFK and flight was fine apart from a number of issues. JFK is a disaster for small airlines as the big boys get priority on departure slots. We waited two hours to be assigned a slot sat nailed to the seat unable to visit the bathroom was no fun for anyone. The endless queues in the immigration lounge also should put off any sane traveller. Other points of interest: The food was good (not exceptional) though service speed was ponderous. The tv system sits on the table and is therefore an aggravation when the food arrives due to lack of room. The choice of films/tv programmes is excellent. The planes are old and the bathrooms are in dire need of a professional upgrade - the current bathrooms have obviously had a paint job but the job was rushed and shabby. FAs are ok - some smile some dont. The seats are fine for the price but don't compare to VA or BA's business class offerings. They are vastly superior to Premium Economy seating. The plane could do with on-screen maps to show the progress of the flight and the PA system is poor. Overall - good flight good airline but still with one or two teething problems.,,,,,4.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Jeri Brittain,,2007-08-01,MaxJet to Dulles flight was cancelled I received an e-mail stating this called MaxJet immediately. They re-routed us on the JFK flight and another flight within the US to get us to Dulles the same day. The only inconvenience in this is that we have to leave 3 hours earlier than planned and we have to fly on 3 airlines instead of two. We have not done this as of yet however MaxJet has been courteous and helpful on the phone. I will report back when the trip is complete.,,,,,4.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,A Lathan,,2007-07-30,Las Vegas to Stansted. I loved the seats food and service onboard Maxjet. Service was wonderful except that they ran out of chicken dinners before we were served and had to choose the Veal. In row 3 I thought we would have been first up but ended up being served last. We chose central aisle seats and loved the freedom they provided. Huge thanks to flight attendants for great service. Stansted to LV went smoothly and our flight even arrived early. Digeplayers worked great food was fine service fine and loved the lounge at Stansted. We shared it with the New York flight and it didn't seem to be overcrowded. Free newspapers snack buffet drinks internet stations were all appreciated. Both my husband and I are in our mid 40's enjoyed our journey with MaxJet. A couple of things I would consider when we book with them again is to not book connecting flights within 24 hours of our arrival in London. We lost our connecting flights (non-refundable) and I'm waiting to see how that works out with MaxJet. The customer service rep promised refunds but I haven't heard back yet. We did purchase trip insurance but we'll see how that works out as well. We had to rebook our connecting flight at more than double the original cost to us. I also wish that Las Vegas had a lounge. If the California flights have a lounge we would probably opt to book via California. Express security is wonderful! I think MaxJet is worth flying a good product at a great price. Just be sure that you can be a bit flexible if the plane is delayed.,,,,,4.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,S Williams,,2007-07-24,LAS-STN return. Missed having a lounge in Vegas but ground staff helpful with pre-boarding with 4 kids. Outbound flight delayed for over 3 hours but crew did a good job of keeping everyone informed and the pilots explained the technicalities. The flight was great cabin crew attentive and food excellent. Baggage delivery took no time at all. Barely made the lounge on the return but it looked great. We usually fly Virgin Upper and I think cabin crew service is pretty close entertainment and food is on par and seats are like an improvement on Premium Economy. The entertainment kept us and 3 kids entertained so there was a good mix of programmes available. I would recommend them and look forward to them flying from San Francisco.,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Every airline sometimes has problems with delays or luggage (just read the reviews on this site to find that out). MaxJet do a fantastic job and given the price you pay it would be crazy to complain! The food is fine the seats comfortable entertainment fine (turn your dinner tray sideways and it all fits by the way!) and service fantastic.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,E Walsh,,2007-07-22,I can't comment on the flight because I never made it. Cancelled my ticket after 5 calls to customer service to change my departure date. They could not give me a quote to change it immediately and never returned my calls after promising every time. Customer service reps on the phone were awful lacking customer care training kept me waiting forever and failed to even apologize for the situation until the 5th call. Then they wanted to charge me nearly $1000 to change my departure date. They were an absolute nightmare and I finally decided to cancel the ticket and rebook with another airline. It was cheaper to do so and I wanted to cut my losses with this company while I still could. Really Maxjet get your act together.,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,G Gasparini,,2007-07-11,Stansted-JFK. We arrived at Stansted at 8am and were told that Maxjet do not open until 8.45am (their website states 7am). We checked in at 8.45am and with security questions etc the process still only took 5 minutes. Fast Track security a boon and we were in the lounge just after 9am. The lounge was lovely - unlimited good quality sandwiches snacks and drinks. The staff were informative and helpful. The downside was that as our flight left nearly 2 hours late by 11am people were arriving for the Las Vegas flight and it became unbearably crowded. Some people did complain about lack of showers and the toilets were located outside the lounge. The flight itself was more of a mixed bag. We were in seats 9A/9B - more than enough legroom and comfortable seats. We were told that due to the late running of the aircraft canapes would not be served - however seats D to K were offered canapes and people in A/B were not. We had ordered a vegetarian meal but were informed by one of the flight attendants they did not have this - but that the fish was very nice! Not having much choice we accepted it and this was served before other passengers. After everyone had been given their main courses we were presented with a vegetarian main dish by another member of the crew. The help yourself larder - containing a sandwich crisps chocolates and fresh fruit - you had to ask a flight attendant for anything you wanted. About an hour before landing afternoon tea was served. We made up a lot of time and actually arrived pretty much on time at 2.30pm. Considering we paid a few pence less than £599 each return I think we received excellent value for money. It was cheaper than Virgin Atlantic economy and service was better than premium economy and world traveller plus. AI would think twice before paying thousands to travel in upper class or business class with another airline. I hope MaxJet can sort out the tiny niggles because they could so easily be put right.,,,,,5.0,,,,,,,,0

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,D Pressley,,2007-06-29,I wish I had discovered this forum before booking with Maxjet then I might not have had such high expectations on my first business class flight to NY. We were booked on their flight to JFK on Friday 15th June (so that was probably our plane which was still on the tarmac - see previous comments). At check-in we were advised there would be a delay as a replacement plane had to be flown in from LAS as there was a problem with ours and as would seem to be the norm we were sent off to the Radisson for breakfast. After a couple more 'time changes' plus some considerable period sitting on the plane whilst supposedly waiting for a second signature on some paperwork (I'm surprised there wasn't a riot!) we eventually departed 12 hrs late. Trying to give Maxjet the benefit of the doubt - these things happen and the plane has to be safe etc. after all - I hoped they would redeem themselves on return journey. Unfortunately that wasn't to be the case. Again we encountered a 3 hr delay this time sitting on the runway whilst air traffic control found us a 'slot'. As has been said previously you do get the feeling of being fobbed-off with what seem feeble excuses but I do feel sorry for the crew who really do try their best and I have to agree that the inflight service etc. is very good. Unfortunately however this is vastly overshadowed by their unreliability. We were not offered any compensation at all but having now read other comments I can probably understand this as it would appear they'd have to compensate almost every passenger. I'm afraid I have to agree with a previous comment that if they don't get their act together pretty quickly they're not going to survive. Word seems to be spreading.,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,0

The recent flush of IAD cancellations has meant that I have got my money back and taken the BA Club offer instead before it's too late. I phoned first and was told ""in the event of our flight being cancelled next month they would only offer another date or refund"".

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Ian Henderson,,2007-06-26,I was scheduled to fly STN-LAS on Saturday 16th June. Arriving from Belfast the night before I noticed a Maxjet still on the ground. On enquiring at their desk was told it was the delayed NY and that it was to fly LAS the next morning - when leaving STN at 23.00! Simple flying maths told me that we must be 7 or 8 hours late. The desk girl said she could not say! Website said flight was on time as it still said on Saturday. Yes the flight was over 8 hours delayed - pax were put up in Radisson SAS for day and allowed £15 for meals. When the NY flight landed that evening the waiting pax cheered in the Maxjet lounge. One surprise was being told by the Captain that we were going via Iceland to refuel - the LR a/c was presumably u/s but we were never told this. Arrival in Vegas was 12.30am and then find a taxi! The stay there was enlivened by trying to find out if the flights were back on time - website page eventually taken down and call centre only - staff there knew of no problems!! Flight back was on time almost. Service was OK seats as expected and price good. Is it sensible to fly an airline with 3 tired aircraft? Maybe.,,,,,3.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,J Travis,,2007-06-21,Maxjet makes it hard to love them. They just canceled tomorrow's Stansted to DC flight which was sold out. They have booked us Upper Class on a Virgin flight (and offered a full refund or change of date) but we were trying to avoid the inconvenience of Heathrow as we live in Cambridge. They cancelled the one other time we tried them - when they cancelled the DC route for the whole winter! I wonder if we will be flying Maxjet back on Monday or Virgin!

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,D Fook,,2007-06-21,STN-LAS-STN. We are Premium Economy upgraders rather than business travellers so our experience of high quality air travel is limited. However thanks to correspondents on this forum we thought we knew what the Maxjet experience would be like. Correct. Stansted is great Fast- Track excellent and the dedicated lounge high quality. OK the planes are a bit old but for us the outward journey was heaven: masses of legroom; attentive friendly high-calibre service; good food and entertainment; and clean toilets. In fact it was close to perfect. We have travelled to Vegas often and never arrived as sprightly and rested as this. To compare it with Virgin Premium Economy is farcical. It was superb. Unfortunately here comes the sting. After booking our flights in February (in the sale at £600 return) we monitored the flights on Maxjet's website to check reliability. Every flight (yes we should get out more). It was excellent for a couple of months but nearing our departure date things started to slip. This coincided with the reinstatement of the Washington service. We are not experts and have no knowledge of the airline business but it seems that Maxjet have barely enough planes to go round. While the Washington route was suspended things were fine now they are flying by the seat of their pants (apologies). Our return plane from Vegas arrived from London 2 hours late. We were told because of a combination of 'abnormal heat in Vegas a full load and a shorter runway because of prevailing winds' we would have to stop in JFK to refuel as we couldn't take off with a full fuel load. 38 degrees in Vegas abnormal? They've not been there often in August then. Total rubbish. We don't know what the problem was - perhaps they borrowed the plane from the Washington route (see comment below from T Williams) and it didn't have as large a fuel tank. Or perhaps it leaked?! Who knows? But it wasn't because it was hot in Vegas. We arrived at Stansted 6 hours late. I personally felt pretty ill when we had to land an hour after going to sleep and then had to sit on the tarmac for an hour. Worse than travelling Economy - possibly. We can't fault the staff (although no apology was ever given for our late arrival) and every other part of the experience was very good. We would go to Vegas again with Maxjet at sale prices as there are limited alternatives. But New York - there would appear to be better choices at similar prices. Do not rely on this airline (certainly while they try to cover too many routes with not enough planes). Just know what you are getting into. If you have two trouble free flights then you'll have a great trip and a bargain to boot.,,,,,3.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,T Willliams,,2007-06-18,"Dulles to STN on June 4 - original aircraft was in for servicing so they replaced our plane with an ""all first class"" 757 previously leased to the Dallas Mavericks basketball team. Seats were above coach but certainly far from first class. Cabin crew were very apologetic and still fed us very good food but a single aisle plane with seats that hardly recline didn't make it up for us. On the taxi trip to STN for our June 17 return we learned through the toll-free celll number that the flight would be delayed 7 1/2 hours. Phone agent would not rebook us - said we had to take care of it after arriving at the STN counter. When we got to the counter we found out the flight had been cancelled. We were put on a shuttle back to Heathrow where we were rebooked in COACH on Virgin! As consolation we were told that we would each receive two vouchers for future travel on Maxjet. We'll see if the vouchers actually show up and if the airline stays in business - otherwise I wouldn't fly these guys unless I had a whole lot of time on either side of the trip to allow for 24 hours of schedule mishaps. Also that it was interesting that of the seven flights operating this week from Dulles to Stansted 2 were delayed 7 hours 2 were delayed over 12 hours and 2 more were completely cancelled.",,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Barry Greenberg,,2007-06-13,"JFK-STN-JFK last week. The plane was full on NY-London run and almost full on the return. Service remains equal if not superior to United/American Intl. business class. The experience can be described as what MaxJet calls traditional business class. This means a comfortable seat with a 60"" pitch (not a flat bed) decent food (the lobster was probably the best in flight meal I have had) alcoholic beverages served by attentive cabin crew and a decent selection of movies. There were some minor issues I would have liked to see improved such as serving dinner sooner and breakfast later and heating up the nuts before serving them (a real time inflight tracker would also be nice as would power ports) but these are minor quibbles. A note to those who would avoid MaxJet because they would rather use or accrue frequent flyer miles on a major carrier: Fly MaxJet instead. I have priced out a business class upgrade on this route on two US carriers and it was the same price before accounting for the 50000-60000 miles I would then need to expend before getting the upgrade. I prefer to save my major carrier miles for when I really need them or they are a better use of miles such as for trips to Asia.",,,,,4.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,John Oram,,2007-06-13,So inadequate were Maxjet's replies to my two e-mails on disrupted seating assignments that I have written to their Customer Services VP an address provided in their onboard literature. Maxjet are offering a dood fare good seat and pretty good food but let themselves down badly on reliability timekeeping and customer service. The comment on the good seat does not apply to 8D/F which they should not be selling as their regular product. My battles on changed seat assignments continued at LAS. It appears that the Reservations department do not fully understand the impact of aircraft changes some of which occur because of Maxjet's flaky reliability. The inbound aircraft was late but still had time to go out on time at 5pm. However they were always chasing the clock when the cabin crew were boarded late perhaps because of the TSA. We didn't push back until 5.15 and then had a 20min taxi. One thing that goes straight out of the window with time constraints is the canape service which I have not seen in a while. I imagine they are loaded so am I to understand that they are simply wasted? Maxjet show an overall time of 10hrs LAS-STN which I think is actually unachievable given the time factors at LAS and flight on two engines. The pilot made a bizarre departure announcement that the forecast weather for London was 54 degrees (F) and must have been reading an actual rather than a forecast. My lobster was unexpected and very good but it would have taken more than an agreeable crustacean to improve my overall impression of Maxjet on my 4th round trip. I can report a highly satisfactory outcome to my latest tranche of queries which eventualy I addressed to VPCS at Maxjet. I received comprehensive and valid responses; given the benefits offered by Maxjet in spite of their occasional failings I shall be happy to travel with them again.,,,,,3.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,C Jones,,2007-06-13,I just travelled with Maxjet to Las Vegas. Service was excellent for the price. The Business class cannot be compared with the likes of BA or Virgin but the price is comparable with Premium Economy. The seat is equivelent to the old style bucket seats. The seat goes back far enough to get a decent night sleep and the configuration is 2-2-2. As for the price I compared their price with Virgin and BMI's Premium economy price. And at just under £800.00 including tax it was a no brainer! I got a further discount from invegas.co.uk. The flight takes a bit longer than Virgin but this is probably due to the smaller plane. If you are a regular business class traveller and you think you are saving a fortune you will be disapointed.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Travers Burge,,2007-06-04,I paid £999.00 each for my wife and myself to fly MAXjet from London Stanstead to Washington Dulles return. The outward flight from London was excellent. Check in VIP lounge cabin services etc were all of a high standard After a very enjoyable but tiring holiday we checked in at Dulles for our flight to Stansted only to be informed that our aircraft for the flight had been changed to a Boeing 737 and that no business class accommodation was now available. Half of the aircraft was economy class and the rest I would classify as an upgrade. We spent over an hour at the check in desk having arrived there at 19.00hrs owing to in my opinion inexperienced check in staff who were incapable of handling the situation. The security personnel sent us back to the check in desk no less than on three occasions firstly because they had not given us any boarding passes and then they had entered the wrong information or no information at all. Our problems did not end there . When we did eventually board the aircraft we remained seated for well nigh three hours before we finally took off at 0.29hrs. During this entire period we were not offered any hospitality and it was only after I had mentioned this to one of the cabin staff that cold water and a small bowl of mixed nuts were offered to the passengers and to add insult to injury the nuts were more or less immediately taken back on the grounds that take off was imminent although we still remained on the ground for another 30 odd minutes. I appreciate and understand that there was a logistical problem that was taxing some of the crew but this still does not detract from the fact that this level of service was a shamble. Where was the welcoming glass of champagne? Dinner was finally served at around 1.30am quite an unsociable hour. The seats were so restricted in their lateral movement so much so that my wife and myself both in our 70's spent a very uncomfortable night. We finally landed at Stansted at 12.30pm. Having paid £999.00 for each person I consider the offer of $500each person in vouchers to fly MAXjet valid for one year as totally inadequate.,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Dorothy Plezia,,2007-05-30,This is not an airline an international passenger would want to connect to for they have a limit of one bag (33lbs US). We were on an international flight so we each had two bags. We kept them at 33 lbs for we knew the weight limit beforehand but did not find anywhere on their website that the limit was 1 bag each. We were charged extra. I will say that the gate agent in Rome took pity on us nad only charged us 30 euro instead of the 80 required. After some discussion in Palermo the agent relented and only charged us 30 euro back to Rome. Other airlines flying to Palermo may not charge for extra baggage so check them out first if you have more than one bag. Windjet flew A319 (similar to Southwest Airlines). Very comfortable left on time personnel was friendly. Other than bag restriction I would fly Windjet again. Price of ticket was very good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,N Lant,,2007-05-13,Stansted to JFK route twice in the last month and overall very happy with service and value. Stansted was great - fast check in fast track through security super lounge easy boarding. Service onboard was good if a little less attentive than most business class services - you had to ask for stuff instead of being constantly asked if you wanted more wine which is the norm in business class. The plane is old and cosmetically tired but what do you expect for £350. The lack of guaranteed connections and inability to check baggage onto connecting flights is worth accepting to get tickets this cheaply especially given the 30 min check in deadline. Korean Air Lounge at JFK was OK but they could do a better job of keeping the drinks stocked up. The free arrivals service at Stansted Radisson more than makes up for it. I am finding these newer airlines a breath of fresh air after years of Delta misery and look forward to seeing their network expanding further. Maxjet is keen to please and see their business expand through positive word of mouth. That is certainly happening - my only worry is that they'll use the higher load factors as an excuse to crank the prices up!,,,,,4.0,,,,,,,,0

Flight was almost full and seemed to take ages to get everyone on board so pre flight drinks were served 30 mins into flight. Seats comfy enough although they are already showing signs of age plenty of room. Service was amateurish the crew seemed disorganized and I was trapped behind a tray table for over an hour watching the keystone cops handing out cold bread rolls. Rest of the flight was fine digiplayer was good and good selection of movies seat was great and even managed to grab a few hours sleep. Terminal 2 at LAS really is a dump! Inbound - No lounge this time and waiting for a business class flight in a bus shelter isn't on. Flight left late (again) but got a drink while we were on the ground this time as a sign of the service to come we managed to take off with several passengers still with champagne glasses on seats and in hand (a few rolled down the aisle). Service looked abysmal again (this seems to be a feature) not sure how they manage this with just 96 of us! I opted for minimal food and got out from under a tray table after just 20 mins decided to sleep for as long as possible large 80's style seats were great for a snooze resulting in 6 hrs shuteye! Toilets are grotty and worth avoiding if at all possible. Breakfast was a weird mixed grill wrap? which was luke warm managed to hang onto digiplayer until 40 mins from landing much to the annoyance of cabin crew. We landed 1 hr late no apology or even reason just late! Overall Maxjet need to change either quit pushing ""all business class"" and call it ""huge seat at a low price"" or sort out the service and cut passengers some slack to sleep or watch TV when they like!

Very enjoyable outbound flight - attentive inflight service though the food quality and quantity is a big let-down. Comfortable seat for the price. Inflight entertainment via DigEplayers. Unsure why it needed to be collected 1.5 hours before landing - seem to be the policy as occurs on both directions. Surely 1/2 hour prior to is sufficient. Las Vegas to London flight on time but inflight service is less than attractive. Some cabin crews appeared to be less experienced. Food ran out rather fast on the dinner service with bread roll served cold. Being an overnight flight it would be logical to dim the cabin lights and lower the shades after dinner serving - none had been acted upon. If you miss out of the initial breakfast serving 2 hours before landing be prepared to starve until arrival - very unimaginative. With a near full flight good refill of toiletries is essential - not so on this flight.

Lounge at Stansted comfortable and located next to gate. Flight departed on time. Although the seats may be from a bygone era of international business class travel they are more than adequate to work or doze off. FA's extremely polite serving food and drink that is better than I've experienced in BA's club world. Personal tv is perfect and comes pre-loaded with latest films etc. Return leg just as good with exception of crowded Korean Airlines lounge at JFK and the annoying blast of music 2 hours before landing that wakes everyone for breakfast. A far more satisfying experience than the similarly priced premium economy cabins of BA or Virgin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Rohan McCarthy,,2006-02-13,SYD-MEL-SYD. It's hard to fault their in-flight service. 60 seats all business-class. Their pre and after-sales services needs refining. Having already had a schedule change notification a few days before the SYD-MEL leg I was annoyed and frustrated to wake up on the morning of the flight driving from Canberra to Sydney to get another message they had left very late the night before telling me that the 9am flight had been cancelled - and I'd been put on the 8am flight instead. That might have been fine if I'd lived in Sydney but it made the drive up to Sydney from Canberra fast and furious! I tried many times to contact OzJet's customer service line after their 6am opening but couldn't - it took them to call me at 6:45am before they realised their incoming call line had not been activated for the morning! When I arrived in Sydney I had to use valet parking ($139) in order to make my flight. Before the return leg I logged on to check the flight details only to find the MEL-SYD portion had mysteriously disappeared from my online itinerary. After ringing them I was told that it had been a mistake; they had deleted that portion instead of the cancelled flight a few days earlier! I was put back on the flight but really business won't wear this sort of inconvenience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

spicejet,/airline-reviews/spicejet,SpiceJet customer review,Arti Gupta,United Arab Emirates,2015-07-02,"My experience on SpiceJet was the worst I have ever had. It started off right from Dubai airport at check-in. My flight was meant to depart at 23:10hrs. The display said 23:10 when we entered the queue and within minutes the display for Delhi departure turned to 02:20hrs. A member of the ground staff came to the queue and announced all Delhi passengers to leave the queue as the Delhi check-in had been closed - no reason was given. So my son and I left the queue and sat down in the waiting area. After about 45 minutes we asked another member of staff and we were told the check-in had re-opened - no announcement had been made though. After check-in I contemplated returning home and coming back 2.5 hours later - when I asked how I can get accurate flight status I was told it is best to hang around at the airport. Even the SpiceJet website would not give up to date information as the delay was owing to incoming flight being diverted to Mumbai. So we decided to stay on airport. The flight was further delayed to 03:30hrs. After an uncomfortably long wait we finally boarded. Everyone was tired and the cabin lights were dimmed after take-off. I thought I should use the washroom before settling down. To my horror I found there was no soap or hand towels. When I asked the cabin crew they said ""sorry madam, it is finished. This flight was diverted to Mumbai and the aircraft was not serviced in Dubai so we have run out of supplies"". I returned to my seat and tried to get some sleep. The rest of the flight was uneventful but devoid of service of any kind. There was no drinks and snacks, even though it is meant to be a paid service. Not even water was offered to the passengers - only those who asked got it. At one point I woke up and went to the galley to ask for water and the air hostesses were asleep! Unacceptable standards of service. Agreed SpiceJet is a budget airline but even so there is something called professionalism which was totally lacking here.

It was scheduled to stop at Mumbai but changed to Hyderabad. At Hyderabad no one was sure whether we continue in the same flight or change planes. After 10-20 mins we learnt that we needed to get on another plane. Again we got the message that meals are not available in the flight and even no water bottle given to us in all the flights.

Also they served our meals first before our drinks which should have been the other way around. We nearly choked waiting for our beverage. Food however was of excellent quality.

Both times the flight was delayed by 15-30 minutes from the scheduled departure. The biggest let down about Spicejet is the fact that they have a very extensive food menu but they don't have any food or beverages onboard (except for water). I had pre-booked and paid for a meal (Chicken Sandwich) for my onward flight which was never served to me. The reason given to me was that there was no food available onboard. Don't get fooled by the pre-booking discount (20%) they offer as they charge a convenience fee which eventually escalates the price more than buying the same meal on flight. The FA's just keep running from one end of the fuselage to the other carrying papers in their hand. I can't recommend Spicejet.,,,Economy,,5.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,,,3.0,0

Only one flight managed to make it to the destination on time. Worse SpiceJet does not pay for hotels or offer any sort of recompense when they cancel a flight due to operational issues (including not having enough passengers) all they offer is to book you on the next available SpiceJet fight (note that they refuse to buy you a ticket on any other airline) which is usually the next day and forces you to either pay for an additional hotel night out of pocket or lose a night that you had already paid for. They don't even offer to make the seat selection free after forcing you to change your plans completely. The additional 250 rupee charge is just a slap in the face after they tell you there is nothing they can do about completely disrupting your travel a day before you are supposed to leave.

spicejet,/airline-reviews/spicejet,SpiceJet customer review,B Dsouza,United States,2012-11-22,Less than 24 hours after I booked my ticket online I got a text message letting me know that the flight time had changed by 30 minutes. On the way to the airport I got another text message letting me know that my flight would be delayed by 30 minutes. I got to the airport and was told the delay would now be an hour. One hour later after the original departure time the plane didn't show up for another 30 minutes. The plane was small but clean and looked new. Bottled water was handed to everybody. Overall the flight was pleasant but the delays make the trip exhausting for I spent more than 4 hours at the airport. Also while it was nice they sent a text message it would have been nice if they sent an email. I'm not an Indian resident but got a local phone and realized I wouldn't have known about the flight changes if I didn't have a local phone.,,,Economy,,6.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,,,3.0,1
spicejet,/airline-reviews/spicejet,SpiceJet customer review,V Agarwal,United Kingdom,2012-10-23,MAA-TRV. Chennai Airport looks like it needs replacing and the security queue snaked around the terminal building. The flight was late boarding mainly because the domestic terminal only had two gates in use. Aircraft was a modern Bombardier Q400 which was two thirds empty. The wrong aircraft safety card was in my seat pocket I showed this to one of the crew and she replaced it. Cabin Crew were attentive and efficient in their tasks. Flight arrived 30 minutes late into Trivandrum and the bags took about 15 minutes to come out.,,,Economy,,8.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,4.0,1
spicejet,/airline-reviews/spicejet,SpiceJet customer review,Rishad Patell,India,2012-09-30,Flew Bombay to Kochi on Spicejet. Early morning departure and a full plane. My partner and I got seats in the last row - uncomfortable and cramped for the 2 hour flight but a full flight so no chance of changing seats. Poor service on board with terrible crew. Got to Kochi only to be told the return flight was cancelled on our date of return. Called their Customer service and were rebooked very efficiently on another flight- and even to a new destination as we had missed a connection. Flight back much better. Service great. Was like flying 2 different airlines.,,,Economy,,7.0,,,,,,,4.0,1
spicejet,/airline-reviews/spicejet,SpiceJet customer review,J Padma,India,2012-09-11,We were flying to Trivandrum from Chennai. The journey takes about one hour fifteen minutes. The flight was announced and we boarded at 6.30 pm and were supposed to take off at 7 pm. No announcement till 7.15 pm. When passengers approached the cabin crew they did not know what was happening. The flight crew was arguing with the ground staff. There was nothing to eat or drink. The pilot announced that there will be some refreshments but nothing came. Finally after an hour and half the flight took off. We reached Trivandrum around 9.30 pm. The experience was awful. If there was an issue the airlines should have delayed the flight instead of boarding passengers and make them wait on the Tarmac without any option of cancelling the journey or even getting refreshments. We never did the mistake of taking a Spicejet flight again.,,,Economy,,1.0,,,,,,,1.0,0
spicejet,/airline-reviews/spicejet,SpiceJet customer review,S Srivastava,United States,2012-06-27,This is a low fare airlines that appeals to many budget minded travelers. However the airlines baggage policy is completely out of line with the international standards. For example most international carriers offers checked-in luggage up to 23 Kg while SpiceJet is only 20 Kg. The carry-in is limited to 7 Kg only. When you check in your luggage after arriving from overseas journey SpiceJet charges 200 Rupees per Kg an extraordinarily high rate. Checking-in Staff are eager to charge and seldom give a consideration to a traveler's appeal. One feels trapped as there is no option. My advice to SpiceJet increase the weight limit to 23 Kg and institute a flat fee in Indian Rupees equivalent to $25 dollars for an extra piece of checked-in luggage not the 200 Rupees per Kg rate. My advice to international travelers do not expect any concession from ground staff; most of them are trigger-happy to charge fees for extra weight.,,,Economy,,2.0,,,,,,,1.0,1

spicejet,/airline-reviews/spicejet,SpiceJet customer review,Mohit R Singal,India,2011-09-10,DEL-KTM-DEL on a relatively old B737-800. Nothing much is expected from a LCC but the worst part was the leg room and space. As we were travelling with our 6 month old child we barely moved for the entire 1.5 hrs flight due to limited space.

I'm 5'11 and my knees kept knocking the seat in front. Agreed Economy airlines offer bad legroom but this was hopeless. Luckily I was the only person in my row and could get some extra room by reclining the middle seat. Food is not free as with most budget carriers rates are good.,,,Economy,,4.0,,,,,,,1.0,0
spicejet,/airline-reviews/spicejet,SpiceJet customer review,Siddhant Verma,India,2011-07-22,SpiceJet from Hyderabad-Delhi. My sister had booked a ticket for me using an international credit card but when she realised the ticket should be booked using Indian credit card if the ticket owner is not travelling she managed to get an Indian credit card from her friend and called customer care of SpiceJet and made the payment using the Indian credit card. When I reached check-in I was told I can't board the flight because payment had been made using a credit card of someone else. They didn't listen to me we had checked 4-5 times with the airline when making the payment that this would be okay. I was harassed by the staff and they asked me to pay the money in cash. Finally they took cash and asked me to sign a declaration and only then could I board the flight. When I reached home and called their customer care they just said sorry it's our system's fault.,,,Economy,,,,,,,,,1.0,0
spicejet,/airline-reviews/spicejet,SpiceJet customer review,Rishad Patell,India,2011-02-28,Pune to Delhi return. The outbound was delayed and so my 11am departure became a 3pm departure. They kept messaging us the delayed time but does not help when you have appointments you are missing. The ground staff in Pune had no empathy and we got not even a hint of an apology for the delay. Cabin crew nicer - friendly attitude and good service. Return delayed as well by one hour. Check in staff in Delhi no better. The only reason I would not recommend this airline is that every flight on both days seemed to be running late.,,,Economy,,6.0,,,,,,,4.0,0

The departure was on time and plane was spotless. Seats were allocated there were no charges for checked luggage and a bottle of water was given to each passenger. In row 11 the seat pitch was fairly tight but only a problem when the person in front reclined her seat.

spicejet,/airline-reviews/spicejet,SpiceJet customer review,Anish Patil,Netherlands,2010-07-24,Cochin to Mumbai.

spicejet,/airline-reviews/spicejet,SpiceJet customer review,J Patel,United States,2010-02-02,We booked our tickets on Spicejet with a travel agent in Surat on August 2009 for travel January 2010 for Goa to Mumbai flight in the afternoon so some of us can catch a flight back to US from Mumbai that night. As we were standing in line at Goa airport for more than an hour they took down the Mumbai sign at the check in counter. On inquiry the check in person told us the flight was cancelled and the fare will be refunded to the travel agent- no other assistance or help. We had to scramble to GoAir counter to get to Mumbai before we are no show at the international flight. GoAir charged us INR 45951 for 7 tickets to Mumbai. Spicejet is irresponsible in its policies and attitude. They left 200+ international passengers in limbo at a place without accomodation or any other help. In light of our experience I would advise anyone with any plans for further travel to stay away from booking their tickets on Spicejet unless they want to jeopardize their plans and wallet!,,,Economy,,,,,,,,,1.0,1
spicejet,/airline-reviews/spicejet,SpiceJet customer review,T Schroeder,,2009-12-28,Keenly priced tickets. They take a practical view of baggage allowances which is very helpful.

spicejet,/airline-reviews/spicejet,SpiceJet customer review,Kurt Müller,,2009-11-23,CJB - DEL (via HYD). Departure punctual arrival late due to endless approach into Delhi. Whilst you get what you pay for in terms of service on this type of airline I was surprised at the rudeness of the CC. When on the ground in HYD one of them addressed me as if I was an inmate in a prison camp for wishing to use the toilet. However in the air with turbulence warning and seat belt signs on pax were walking up and down to the toilet freely.,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,0
spicejet,/airline-reviews/spicejet,SpiceJet customer review,G Abrol,,2009-05-17,Mumbai-Delhi check-in did not take very long. Seats were pre-assigned as the flight was full 20 mins delay departing.

spicejet,/airline-reviews/spicejet,SpiceJet customer review,A Sanghvi,,2008-11-07,BOM-DEL and IXB-KOL. Both flights were heavily delayed.

spicejet,/airline-reviews/spicejet,SpiceJet customer review,David Leston,,2008-07-29,Delhi to Srinagar via Jammu. The time of my web-booked flight had changed but I had not been notified of this and therefore arrived at the airport far too early. Luckily there was an earlier flight and the person at the ticket counter changed my booking to this flight at no extra cost. Seats were allocated at check in but there was no scramble anyway as there were only 100 passengers. The 737-800 was clean and the crew were quite friendly. Overall a positive experience - but Spicejet have already started cutting routes and frequencies so things are looking tough for the Indian locos.,,,,,4.0,,,,,,,,0

spicejet,/airline-reviews/spicejet,SpiceJet customer review,Kurt Mueller,,2008-03-30,DEL-CJB (via HYD). We chose this flight for its convenient timing. SpiceJet's ticket office at Delhi Airport is very hard to find (as an exception to the rule it's located outside the temporary ticketing hall). Check-in friendly and efficient. Boarding via a bus with a ridiculously high step. Flight left on time meaning we actually lifted off the runway at the scheduled time of 1710 (a miracle given today's crowded Indian airports). Onboard catering limited and expensive. On the second leg (HYD-CJB) there were two incidents of altercations between cabin crew and pax mainly over the issue of the complimentary water bottles not being provided (ostensibly because of turbulence preventing service although the seatbelt signs were NOT on) yet the FAs were happy to serve anyone who wanted to purchase any food or beverages. These two unpleasant situations were not handled well by what came across as a particularly arrogant FA. Landed in CJB on time.,,,,,4.0,,,,,,,,0
spicejet,/airline-reviews/spicejet,SpiceJet customer review,S Srinivasan,,2007-12-23,PNQ-HYD. I booked with a foreign credit card which caused a bit of a delay at check-in. All boarding at Pune is done via remote stands though it was done quite efficiently and we actually pushed back 5 minutes early. The plane was a B737-800 and it was clean and well-maintained. The FAs were efficient and friendly. There's no IFE at all but since the flight time was only 1 hour it wasn't a big deal. Main complaint was the seat pitch which seemed a bit tight though it was manageable for a 1 hour flight. Being an LCC you had to pay for everything on board except for water but the prices are reasonable - 20 rupees (about 50 cents) for juice and 60 rupees (about $1.50) for a sandwich. You also have to pay to pre-reserve a seat online but again the cost is negligible at 50 rupees (about $1.25). If you are booking online also beware that you will be offered trip insurance after you select your flights and the default is set to yes so pay attention before finalizing your purchase. The flight arrived at HYD about 5 minutes early and although my bag was the last on the carousel it only took about 10 minutes to appear. Overall a good value for the price I paid at about $52 for an advance purchase one-way ticket.,,,,,3.0,,,,,,,,0

spicejet,/airline-reviews/spicejet,SpiceJet customer review,Teemu Hentunen,,2007-05-16,DEL-BOM-DEL. A good and cheap budget carrier. New spotless aircraft friendly service and flights were in time.
